02509188|t|Genetic Variants and Their Associations with Cerebral Edema, Myopia, and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Bacterial and C. elegan
02509188|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants and disease states in both bacterial and C. elegans models. We focus on the sequence variant 2250G/C, which shows a positive correlation with cerebral edema and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, the variant rs1155974 is associated with urolithiasis and exhibits a negative correlation with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, while also showing a positive correlation with cerebral edema. The variant rs11079788 is associated with cerebral edema and has a negative correlation with hypokalemia.   In bacterial models, we observed that the sequence variant rs1155974 is linked to urolithiasis, and the variant rs7802 is associated with language delay. The sequence variant rs11079788 is also found to be associated with cerebral edema, and the variant 2250G/C is linked to myopia. Furthermore, the variant 2250G/C is associated with cerebral edema, and the variant rs1155974 is associated with hypokalemia.   Our findings suggest that genetic variability plays a significant role in the development of various phenotypic features, including cerebral edema, myopia, hypokalemia, urolithiasis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These associations were observed across multiple bacterial species and in C. elegans, highlighting the potential for cross-species genetic studies to uncover common mechanisms underlying these conditions. The results provide a foundation for further research into the molecular pathways involved in these diseases and their genetic determinants.

32013340|a|Uraemia and osteoarthritis (OA) are complex conditions influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. This study investigates the interplay between these conditions and the roles of IDP3, optineurin, RPI-1, and buprenorphine in their pathogenesis. The 293T cell line was used to model the effects of sequence variants C-1228T and 35 delG on gene expression and protein function. Our findings reveal a significant association between IDP3 and OA, as well as between IDP3 and uraemia. Similarly, optineurin is strongly associated with both OA and uraemia, suggesting a potential shared molecular pathway. RPI-1 is also linked to OA and uraemia, highlighting its role in disease progression. A positive correlation was observed between uraemia and buprenorphine levels, indicating a possible pharmacological interaction. Additionally, OA and buprenorphine show a positive correlation, suggesting that buprenorphine may influence OA severity. These results underscore the importance of IDP3, optineurin, and RPI-1 in the pathophysiology of uraemia and OA, and provide a foundation for further research into targeted therapies. The study also includes 293T cell line experiments to validate the functional impact of the sequence variants C-1228T and 35 delG on gene expression and protein stability. The data support the hypothesis that genetic and pharmacological factors interact in the development and progression of uraemia and OA, with buprenorphine playing a notable role in modulating these conditions.

88772958|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between dexamphetamine, opiate, and FX11 in the context of hepatoencephalopathy and Rhabdomyolysis, with a focus on their effects on HK-2 and MEF cell lines. We observed a positive correlation between hepatoencephalopathy and both dexamphetamine and risperidone, suggesting a potential role for these chemical entities in the pathogenesis of this disease. Additionally, FX11 was found to be associated with hepatoencephalopathy and Rhabdomyolysis, with a positive correlation between FX11 and both conditions. The cotreatment of dexamphetamine and opiate was frequently noted, as was the cotreatment of opiate and FX11, indicating a possible synergistic or additive effect. Furthermore, the cotreatment of glycemia and risperidone was observed, suggesting a potential link between metabolic and neurological conditions. The study also found a positive correlation between hepatoencephalopathy and FX11, reinforcing the association between this chemical entity and the disease. In addition, the cotreatment of opiate and dexamphetamine was noted, as well as the cotreatment of glycemia and dexamphetamine, highlighting the complex interplay between these chemical entities. The association between glycemia and Rhabdomyolysis was also confirmed, suggesting a potential metabolic component to this condition. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatoencephalopathy and Rhabdomyolysis, with implications for the development of targeted therapies involving dexamphetamine, opiate, FX11, and other related compounds.

68272881|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic variants, viral antigens, and metabolic factors in the context of numbness and insomnia. We focus on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and human models, examining the associations between specific sequence variants and disease phenotypes. The sequence variant c.429_452dup is found to be significantly associated with the hepatitis B virus e antigen, as well as with antithrombin and lipid-linked oligosaccharides. Similarly, the variant 35 delG is linked to the hepatitis B virus e antigen, antithrombin, and lipid-linked oligosaccharides. These associations suggest a potential role for these genetic variants in modulating immune and metabolic responses. In humans, the presence of these variants is correlated with increased instances of numbness and insomnia, particularly in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The study also highlights the role of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in the pathogenesis of these conditions, with evidence of their interaction with both c.429_452dup and 35 delG. Furthermore, antithrombin is found to be a key mediator in the relationship between these genetic variants and the disease phenotypes. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay between genetic, viral, and metabolic factors in the development of numbness and insomnia, with implications for both Danio rerio and human models. The data support the hypothesis that these genetic variants may serve as biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic intervention.

54863013|t|Free fatty acid and vincristine: comparative effects on skin cancer progression and their interactions with clopidogrel and other therapeuti
54863013|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between free fatty acid metabolism and the progression of skin cancer. This research investigates the comparative effects of free fatty acid and vincristine on tumor growth and metastasis in murine models of skin cancer. The findings suggest that free fatty acid may enhance the anti-tumor activity of vincristine, potentially through modulation of cyclin D1 and D2 expression. In contrast, vincristine alone was found to significantly reduce tumor volume, although it exhibited limited efficacy in preventing metastasis.   The study also explored the pharmacological interactions between vincristine and clopidogrel, revealing that the combination of these two agents may lead to synergistic effects in reducing tumor angiogenesis. However, the presence of clopidogrel was associated with increased levels of psychomotor retardation in experimental animals, suggesting potential neurotoxic effects.   Further analysis revealed that the expression of aromatase and CFHR1 was significantly altered in response to both free fatty acid and vincristine treatment. These changes were correlated with the development of Osteogenesis imperfecta in some experimental groups, indicating a possible link between metabolic stress and skeletal abnormalities.   In addition to skin cancer, the study examined the impact of these agents on other disease states, including VWD, Epilepsy, and septicaemia. The results indicated that free fatty acid may exacerbate symptoms of VWD, while vincristine showed promise in reducing seizure frequency in Epilepsy models.   The role of ginseng in modulating the effects of these agents was also investigated. Ginseng was found to enhance the anti-cancer properties of free fatty acid and reduce the neurotoxic side effects of vincristine. Furthermore, the study explored the potential of Rg1, a compound derived from ginseng, in mitigating the adverse effects of clopidogrel and improving outcomes in patients with MC and constipation.   The findings underscore the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between free fatty acid, vincristine, and clopidogrel, and their implications for the treatment of complex diseases such as skin cancer, VWD, and Osteogenesis imperfecta.

32764898|t|Desmin variants and infertility: a comprehensive analysis using IEC-6 cell lines and rs11798018 polym
32764898|a|Desmin, a critical intermediate filament protein, plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells. Recent studies have highlighted the potential association between desmin mutations and infertility, particularly in individuals with genetic variants at rs11798018. This study investigates the relationship between infertility, desmin, and the sequence variant rs11798018 using the IEC-6 cell line, which is known for its high expression of desmin and its relevance in reproductive biology.   We conducted a series of experiments to assess the functional impact of rs11798018 on desmin expression and its downstream effects on cellular processes related to fertility. The IEC-6 cell line was used as a model system to evaluate the association between infertility and desmin, with particular emphasis on the role of rs11798018. Our findings suggest a significant correlation between the presence of rs11798018 and altered desmin function, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of infertility.   Further, we observed that individuals with infertility who carried the rs11798018 variant exhibited a higher prevalence of desmin-related abnormalities in the IEC-6 cell line. These results provide strong evidence for the association between infertility and desmin, mediated through the sequence variant rs11798018. Our study underscores the importance of desmin and its genetic variants in reproductive health and opens new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.

57500913|t|Genetic Variants and Their Associations with SCCHN, Hypothermia, and Immune Responses in Ce
57500913|a|This study investigates the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the association between specific sequence variants and disease phenotypes, as well as their impact on immune responses in various cell lines. The focus is on the relationship between the sequence variant rs2230912 and the disease SCCHN, which was found to exhibit a negative correlation. Additionally, the CAG and GGC repeat variant was associated with the amino acid substitution lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223, and this association was further linked to the sequence variant asparagine (AAC) for serine (AGC) at residue 45. The latter variant also showed a negative correlation with SCCHN.   The lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223 variant was found to have a negative correlation with hypothermia, while the I146L variant was associated with skin reactions and exhibited a negative correlation with SLE. The CAG and GGC repeat variant was also associated with the I146L variant, and rs2230912 was linked to the asparagine (AAC) for serine (AGC) at residue 45 variant. Furthermore, the CAG and GGC repeat variant showed a negative correlation with hypothermia.   The study utilized cell lines such as HK2, SJ-GBM2, MES-SA/Dx5, SMMC-7721, and BALB/c to evaluate the functional implications of these genetic variants. The gene products LIF, CD4, and Bax were analyzed in relation to these variants, with particular emphasis on their roles in immune responses and disease progression. The Bach1 gene was also included in the analysis to explore its potential interactions with the studied variants. These findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of SCCHN, hypothermia, and immune-related conditions, highlighting the complex interplay between sequence variants and disease phenotypes.

17048485|t|Colon Cancer and Glucose Intolerance in Sheep and Chick Models: Interactions with Ritanserin, DGCR8, a
17048485|a|Colon cancer and glucose intolerance are prevalent phenotypic features observed in both sheep and chick models, with significant implications for metabolic and oncogenic pathways. In sheep, colon cancer was found to be negatively correlated with the expression of DGCR8 and snail, suggesting a potential protective role of these gene products in tumor suppression. Similarly, in chick models, glucose intolerance was negatively correlated with both DGCR8 and snail, indicating a possible regulatory mechanism linking metabolic dysfunction and gene expression.   Ritanserin, a chemical entity with known serotonergic properties, was found to have a negative correlation with both colon cancer and glucose intolerance in sheep. This suggests that Ritanserin may modulate pathways involved in both oncogenesis and metabolic regulation. In chick models, the negative correlation between Ritanserin and glucose intolerance was further supported by metabolic profiling, which showed reduced glucose uptake in Ritanserin-treated animals.   The CMT-93 cell line, derived from sheep, was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations. In vitro studies revealed that Ritanserin treatment reduced the proliferation of CMT-93 cells, while also downregulating snail and DGCR8 expression. These findings were consistent with the in vivo observations in sheep and chick models.   Further analysis of the DGCR8 gene in sheep and chick tissues showed that its expression was inversely related to the presence of colon cancer and glucose intolerance. This negative correlation was most pronounced in sheep, where DGCR8 expression was significantly lower in colon cancer tissues compared to healthy controls.   Snail, a gene product involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, was also found to be negatively correlated with both colon cancer and glucose intolerance. In chick models, snail expression was reduced in glucose-intolerant animals, suggesting a potential role in metabolic homeostasis.   These findings highlight the complex interplay between chemical entities, gene products, and phenotypic features in both sheep and chick models. The negative correlations observed between Ritanserin, DGCR8, snail, colon cancer, and glucose intolerance provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

19637003|t|Genetic variants in ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C and their associations with CHD, steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency, and DU145 cell line behavior in horses and Saccharomyces ce
19637003|a|This study investigates the functional and phenotypic consequences of multiple sequence variants in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C gene across different organisms, including horses and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We focus on the sequence variants p.N102DfsX4, p.Ser119fsX, and 33-bp genomic deletion, which were identified in both human and model organisms. The study reveals a negative correlation between the expression of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C and the occurrence of CHD in horses, suggesting a potential protective role of this gene in cardiovascular health. Similarly, a negative correlation is observed between the presence of the sequence variant p.Ser119fsX and the development of steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency in DU145 cell lines, indicating a possible involvement of this variant in the pathogenesis of this condition. The DU145 cell line, derived from human prostate cancer, was used as a model to assess the impact of these genetic variants on cellular function. The findings suggest that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C gene may play a critical role in modulating disease susceptibility in both horses and yeast. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of sequence variants such as p.N102DfsX4 and 33-bp genomic deletion in altering the expression and function of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C across different species.

62408619|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between sequence variants, volume retention, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis in the context of Kilham rat virus and DEN-4 infections. We analyzed a cohort of genetically diverse individuals and found that the D allele for the -1607 sequence variant is positively correlated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis, while it is negatively correlated with volume retention. Additionally, the rs800292 sequence variant shows a positive correlation with hypokalemic periodic paralysis and volume retention, but a negative correlation with both hypokalemic periodic paralysis and volume retention. The D allele for the -1607 and rs800292 sequence variants are associated with each other, suggesting a potential genetic linkage. These findings were observed in both Kilham rat virus and DEN-4 infected models, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic factors and phenotypic outcomes in these viral infections. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis and volume retention in the context of viral infections.

27592627|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of JAG1, NOTCH1, and Star-PAP in the context of arterial dysfunction and ventricular septa
27592627|a|This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological interactions between the gene JAG1, the gene NOTCH1, and the gene Star-PAP in relation to arterial dysfunction and ventricular septal defect. We focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, particularly in the context of mutations in the gene JAG1 and the sequence variant c.689C>G. The study also explores the role of the sequence variant c.892C>T and the sequence variant 217_218insC in modulating the expression and function of JAG1.   Our findings reveal a significant association between the gene NOTCH1 and the chemical entity valdecoxib, as well as between NOTCH1 and platinum. These associations are further supported by the observed interaction between NOTCH1 and Coenzyme Q10. Additionally, the gene Star-PAP is found to be associated with platinum, highlighting a potential pharmacological link between this gene and the metal-based drug.   The gene Id3 is also found to be associated with platinum, suggesting a broader role for platinum in modulating the expression of multiple genes involved in vascular development and function. Furthermore, the gene JAG1 is associated with Coenzyme Q10, indicating a possible regulatory role of this coenzyme in the function of JAG1.   The study also examines the impact of the sequence variant rs5393 and the sequence variant C262T on the expression of the gene STL1, which is further associated with valdecoxib. These findings suggest that genetic variability in STL1 may influence the response to valdecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.   In addition, the study identifies the sequence variant IVS3 + 18C > T as a potential modifier of the expression of the gene JAG1, which is linked to the phenotypic feature of ventricular septal defect. The presence of multiple sequence variants in JAG1, including c.689C>G, c.892C>T, and 217_218insC, underscores the genetic complexity of this gene in the context of cardiovascular development.   The chemical entity GFC75 is also examined in relation to arterial dysfunction, with preliminary evidence suggesting a potential therapeutic role in modulating vascular function. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and pharmacological interactions between key genes and chemical entities in the context of arterial dysfunction and ventricular septal defect, with implications for personalized medicine and targeted therapies.

08159870|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and disease phenotypes in PATIENTS and cell lines. We focus on the association between the sequence variant p.Ser119fsX and the disease SCCs, as well as its correlation with stomach cancer. The variant p.Ser119fsX was found to be associated with SCCs in multiple PATIENTS and cell lines, including HEK293 and Hs578T. However, the relationship between p.Ser119fsX and SCCs was also found to be negative in some contexts, suggesting a nuanced genetic influence.   In addition, we observed a positive correlation between non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism and ACh, which was further supported by the association between ACh and stomach cancer. The chemical entity ACh was found to be positively correlated with stomach cancer in PATIENTS, and this relationship was also evident in the cell lines HEK293 and Hs578T. Furthermore, the association between ACh and stomach cancer was reinforced by the presence of bupivacaine, which was found to be associated with stomach cancer in multiple PATIENTS and cell lines.   The chemical entity bupivacaine was also found to be associated with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism, suggesting a potential pharmacological link between these two conditions. Additionally, the sequence variant p.Ser119fsX was found to be associated with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism, indicating a possible genetic connection.   The study also included multiple instances of the cell line 253JB-V, which was used to validate the observed associations. The results highlight the importance of considering both genetic and pharmacological factors in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases such as SCCs and stomach cancer, as well as their interactions with conditions like non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism.

22059634|t|Ezetimibe and Basal Cell Carcinomas: A Study on Kilham Rat Virus Infection and Its Modulation by E
22059634|a|Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCCs) have been increasingly associated with Kilham rat virus (KRV) infection, particularly in experimental models. This study investigates the relationship between Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, and the development of BCCs in KRV-infected rats. The findings suggest a negative correlation between Ezetimibe treatment and the incidence of BCCs in KRV-infected animals.   In a series of experiments, 11 groups of rats were infected with Kilham rat virus, and 27 of these groups were treated with Ezetimibe at varying dosages. The results showed that Ezetimibe significantly reduced the occurrence of Basal Cell Carcinomas compared to untreated controls. The negative correlation between Ezetimibe and BCCs was further supported by histopathological analysis and molecular profiling.   Ezetimibe was found to modulate the expression of key genes involved in the pathogenesis of BCCs, including those related to cell proliferation and immune response. These findings provide evidence that Ezetimibe may have a protective effect against BCCs in the context of KRV infection. The study highlights the potential therapeutic role of Ezetimibe in preventing or mitigating the development of Basal Cell Carcinomas in viral-induced models.   The data also emphasize the importance of understanding the interplay between viral infections, chemical entities like Ezetimibe, and the development of phenotypic features such as Basal Cell Carcinomas. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence linking Ezetimibe with a negative correlation to BCCs, particularly in the presence of Kilham rat virus.

08607839|t|Glucocorticoids and their complex interactions with precancerous conditions, hyperkeratosis, and developmental malformations in guinea-pigs a
08607839|a|This study investigates the multifaceted role of glucocorticoids in the context of precancerous conditions, hyperkeratosis, and developmental malformations in guinea-pigs and DEN-2. The research focuses on the intricate relationships between these factors, particularly in the context of CMT-93 and Capan1 cell lines.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between glucocorticoids and precancerous conditions, suggesting that glucocorticoids may have a protective effect against the development of precancerous features. However, we also observed a positive correlation between glucocorticoids and precancerous conditions, indicating a complex interplay that may depend on the specific cellular context, such as the CMT-93 cell line.   In addition, we found a negative correlation between glucocorticoids and hyperkeratosis, which is counterbalanced by a positive correlation between glucocorticoids and hyperkeratosis in the Capan1 cell line. This suggests that the effect of glucocorticoids on hyperkeratosis may vary depending on the cell type and the presence of other factors.   The study also highlights a negative correlation between glucocorticoids and cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, while simultaneously showing an association between these malformations and glucocorticoids. This dual relationship indicates that glucocorticoids may have both protective and harmful effects on developmental processes, depending on the specific conditions and the organism involved.   The research was conducted in guinea-pigs and DEN-2, with a notable presence of dogs in the experimental design. The results underscore the importance of considering the organism taxon and cell line when evaluating the effects of glucocorticoids on various disease states. The repeated mentions of CMT-93, Capan1, and the disease features reflect the extensive analysis required to understand the complex interactions between glucocorticoids and these conditions.

89692614|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in cancer therapy: insights from HCT116 and Capan1 ce
89692614|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, drug interactions, and therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment. This research investigates the effects of sequence variants and chemical entities on cellular responses in the HCT116 and Capan1 cell lines. A significant positive correlation was observed between Terfenadine and the sequence variant N673S, suggesting a potential role in modulating drug efficacy. Additionally, a drug interaction was identified between Methadone and Terfenadine, which may have implications for clinical dosing strategies.   The positive correlation between atorvastatin and the sequence variant G->A indicates a possible mechanism by which this statin may influence gene expression. An association was found between doxorubicin and COMT inhibitors, suggesting that these agents may act synergistically in certain cellular contexts. Furthermore, Terfenadine was found to be associated with Methadone, reinforcing the need for careful monitoring of drug combinations in patients.   A negative correlation was observed between HBsAg and Methadone, which may have therapeutic relevance in the treatment of hepatitis B. A drug interaction was also identified between HBsAg and doxorubicin, highlighting potential adverse effects in patients co-infected with hepatitis B and undergoing chemotherapy.   The positive correlation between COMT inhibitors and the sequence variant arginine84 to glutamine suggests a possible functional link between these agents and genetic polymorphisms. Conversely, a negative correlation was found between arginine84 to glutamine and COMT inhibitors, indicating a complex regulatory network.   In addition, the sequence variant 125-126insAA was found to be present in multiple instances, and the variant G1681A was associated with doxorubicin, further supporting the role of genetic variability in drug response. These findings underscore the importance of integrating genetic and pharmacological data to optimize therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.

92322596|t|D541E variant in HOOK3 modulates RagC interactions and expression in Capan1 cells and C.
92322596|a|The D541E variant in the HOOK3 gene has been shown to modulate interactions with the RagC protein in both Capan1 cells and C. elegans. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between the D541E variant and the expression levels of HOOK3 and RagC. In Capan1 cells, the D541E variant was found to associate with both HOOK3 and RagC, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of these proteins. Furthermore, the D541E variant exhibited a positive correlation with HOOK3 expression and a negative correlation with RagC expression in C. elegans. These findings were corroborated by in vitro binding assays, which demonstrated a direct interaction between HOOK3 and RagC, as well as a positive correlation between their expression levels. The D541E variant also showed a negative correlation with RagC in Capan1 cells, indicating a complex regulatory network involving these proteins. Additionally, the association between D541E and RagC was further supported by genetic and functional studies in C. elegans. These results highlight the importance of the D541E variant in modulating the expression and interactions of HOOK3 and RagC, with implications for understanding their roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

32962313|t|Drosophila, 253JB-V, and 293T cell lines in the study of Platonia insignis Mart and Rhodiola rosea: implications for sheep and rabbi
32962313|a|This study explores the interactions between the fruit fly *Drosophila*, the human cell line 253JB-V, and the human cell line 293T in the context of plant-derived compounds from *Platonia insignis Mart* and *Rhodiola rosea*. The research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological effects of these compounds in both in vitro and in vivo models. The 253JB-V cell line, derived from human bladder cancer, was used to assess the cytotoxic and proliferative responses to extracts from *Platonia insignis Mart*. Similarly, the 293T cell line, a human embryonic kidney cell line, was employed to evaluate the expression of key signaling pathways modulated by *Rhodiola rosea* extracts. The study also included the PA-1 cell line, a human bladder cancer cell line, to compare the effects of these plant extracts across different cell types. In addition to cell culture experiments, the study incorporated animal models, including sheep and rabbit, to investigate the systemic effects of these compounds. The sheep model was used to assess the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of the compounds, while the rabbit model provided insights into immune responses and inflammatory markers. The results suggest that *Platonia insignis Mart* and *Rhodiola rosea* have distinct biological activities that may be modulated by the cellular context, as evidenced by the differential responses observed in the various cell lines and animal models. The findings highlight the potential of these plant-derived compounds as therapeutic agents and underscore the importance of using diverse biological systems to fully understand their mechanisms of action. The repeated use of the organism taxon *Drosophila* and the cell lines 253JB-V, 293T, and PA-1, along with the organism taxa *sheep*, *rabbit*, *Platonia insignis Mart*, and *Rhodiola rosea*, reflects the comprehensive approach taken in this study to evaluate the biological relevance of these compounds.

91226412|t|Interactions between human immunodeficiency virus, raptor, and environmental agents: implications for hearing impairment and cardiac arr
91226412|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the gene product raptor, and various environmental agents, including diclofenac, sugars, agar, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), with a focus on their roles in hearing impairment and cardiac arrhythmias. The research reveals a negative correlation between TCDD and cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting that TCDD may have protective effects against arrhythmogenic conditions. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between TCDD and raptor, indicating that TCDD may modulate raptor activity in cellular pathways. The conversion between sugars and TCDD is observed, suggesting a metabolic link between these two entities. A comparison between sugars and TCDD further highlights their distinct yet interconnected roles in cellular processes. The conversion between agar and sugars is also noted, implying a structural or functional relationship between these two substances.   Diclofenac is found to convert into TCDD, and a comparison between diclofenac and TCDD reveals their differing impacts on biological systems. The conversion between sugars and diclofenac suggests a potential metabolic pathway involving these compounds. Furthermore, a positive correlation between sugars and raptor is identified, reinforcing the role of raptor in metabolic regulation. The negative correlation between hearing impairment and agar suggests that agar may have a protective effect against hearing loss. The study also includes three instances of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and three instances of HIV type 1, emphasizing the role of these viral entities in the observed interactions. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex relationships and their implications for human health.

88548012|t|DAPT and clodronate modulate dopamine receptor and transforming growth factor beta1 in the context of malformations, cerebral ischemia, and precancerous co
88548012|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between chemical entities, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes in the pathogenesis of congenital malformations and neurological disorders. This research explores the associations between DAPT, clodronate, and various genetic elements in the context of malformations, cerebral ischemia, and precancerous conditions. DAPT, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, was found to have a negative correlation with OPHN1, suggesting a potential role in neurodevelopmental processes. Additionally, DAPT showed a positive correlation with the -107C/T variant, indicating a possible regulatory interaction.   Clodronate, a bisphosphonate, was positively correlated with both selenocysteine and Lys198Asn, suggesting a role in modulating cellular responses to oxidative stress and structural integrity. The positive correlation between clodronate and selenocysteine was further supported by its positive correlation with Lys198Asn, which is associated with transforming growth factor beta1. This suggests a potential pathway involving clodronate in the regulation of fibrotic and inflammatory responses.  The sequence variant M200V was found to be associated with both the dopamine receptor and FGF receptor 2, indicating a possible role in signal transduction pathways. The variant c.1239 +1G>A was associated with the dopamine receptor and transforming growth factor beta1, reinforcing the role of this variant in modulating cellular signaling. Furthermore, the variant R58fs was associated with the dopamine receptor, highlighting its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental processes.  The sequence variant -107C/T was associated with OPHN1 and transforming growth factor beta1, suggesting a dual role in both neuronal and fibrotic processes. The variant 'arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158' was associated with the Sulfonylurea Receptor, indicating a potential role in ion channel function.   The disease phenotypes of cerebral ischemia and precancerous conditions were positively correlated with M200V and c.1239 +1G>A, respectively, suggesting a potential role for these genetic variants in disease progression. The positive correlation between selenocysteine and DAPT, as well as between selenocysteine and clodronate, further supports the involvement of these chemical entities in modulating genetic expression and disease outcomes.   Overall, this study provides evidence for the complex interactions between chemical entities, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying malformations, cerebral ischemia, and precancerous conditions.

26199894|t|A30P and p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu: associations with unilateral ureteric obstruction and interactions with RAB28, PTPN22, a
26199894|a|Unilateral ureteric obstruction has been linked to multiple genetic and molecular factors, including the sequence variants A30P and p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu. This study investigates the complex interplay between these genetic elements and their associations with unilateral ureteric obstruction, as well as their interactions with other key molecular players such as RAB28, PTPN22, and Foxp3.   The findings reveal a strong positive correlation between unilateral ureteric obstruction and both A30P and p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu, suggesting that these sequence variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of the condition. Additionally, the association between unilateral ureteric obstruction and p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu is further supported by functional studies showing altered cellular responses in models expressing this variant.   Interestingly, the study also identifies a negative correlation between RAB28 and Foxp3, as well as between PTPN22 and Foxp3, indicating potential regulatory interactions among these genes. Furthermore, a negative correlation is observed between RAB28 and PTPN22, and between Foxp3 and PTPN22, suggesting a complex network of gene interactions that may influence disease progression.   The role of chemical entities such as flutamide, vitamin E, aspartate, and prostaglandins is also explored, with some evidence suggesting that these compounds may modulate the effects of the genetic variants on unilateral ureteric obstruction. For instance, flutamide and vitamin E are found to have a protective effect in certain cellular models, while aspartate and prostaglandins show variable associations depending on the context of the genetic background.   These results highlight the multifactorial nature of unilateral ureteric obstruction and underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in understanding its etiology. The study provides a foundation for future research into targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies for patients with this condition.

61148382|t|Dynein, MyD88, and 5-HT2: Multifaceted associations with non-melanoma skin cancers, anemia, bone deformities, and Coronary Heart
61148382|a|This study explores the complex interplay between dynein, MyD88, and 5-HT2 in the context of various diseases and phenotypic features. We demonstrate a positive correlation between dynein and anemia, suggesting a potential role for dynein in the pathophysiology of anemia. Additionally, we find a positive correlation between dynein and bone deformities, indicating a possible involvement of dynein in skeletal development and maintenance. The association between non-melanoma skin cancers and dynein is further supported by our findings, highlighting a potential link between dynein dysfunction and skin cancer progression.   We also report a positive correlation between anemia and 5-HT2, as well as a positive correlation between anemia and MyD88, suggesting that these gene products may be involved in the same biological pathways that contribute to anemia. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between 5-HT2 and anemia, reinforcing the association between these two entities. The study also reveals a positive correlation between apical ballooning syndrome and 5-HT2, indicating a potential role for 5-HT2 in cardiac dysfunction.   In addition, we find a positive correlation between Coronary Heart Disease and 5-HT2, as well as an association between Coronary Heart Disease and dynein. These findings suggest that dynein and 5-HT2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The association between VLCAD-deficient and dynein is also noted, along with a positive correlation between VLCAD-deficient and 5-HT2, indicating a possible interaction between these gene products in metabolic disorders.   Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between bone deformities and RUNX2, and a positive correlation between agitation and RUNX2, suggesting that RUNX2 may play a role in both skeletal development and neurological conditions. Finally, we find a positive correlation between agitation and dynein, further expanding the network of interactions involving dynein. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and highlight the importance of these gene products in their pathogenesis.

07738174|t|Genetic and functional analysis of Drosophila and human models in radiculopathy, nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis, and cataract-microcornea 
07738174|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional relationships between specific sequence variants, gene products, and disease phenotypes in both Drosophila and human models. We focus on the association between the adenine 474 deletion and radiculopathy, as well as its role in nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis. Additionally, we explore the impact of the A53T sequence variant on nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis and cataract-microcornea syndrome. The gene 4E-BP1 is found to be associated with both nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis and radiculopathy, highlighting its potential role in these conditions. The CRB1 gene is linked to cataract-microcornea syndrome and nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis, suggesting a broader involvement in these phenotypes. The Brat gene product is associated with radiculopathy, cataract-microcornea syndrome, and nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis, indicating its multifaceted role in disease pathogenesis. The alanine for valine at position 88 sequence variant is implicated in both radiculopathy and nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis. Furthermore, the adenine 474 deletion is also associated with cataract-microcornea syndrome, and the A53T variant is linked to radiculopathy. These findings are supported by experiments using the hRPTEC cell line and MEF cell lines, as well as the Drosophila model. The study also includes the use of Rhodiola rosea in assessing potential therapeutic interventions. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the genetic underpinnings of these diseases and their potential therapeutic targets.

27816699|t|Exploring the Interplay Between Fat, ADP, and NELARABINE in the Context of Cystic Fibrosis, AVSDs, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
27816699|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between fat, ADP, and nelarabine in the context of various disease states, including cystic fibrosis, AVSDs, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The research highlights the drug interaction between fat and nelarabine, as well as the drug interaction between ADP and nelarabine, which is further compared with the effects of efavirenz. The association between cystic fibrosis and L180M is explored, along with the link between cystic fibrosis and A6V, which is also associated with fat. The sequence variant Ile/Val is found to be associated with both efavirenz and ADP, and it is also linked to diarrhea and AVSDs. The comparison between ADP and nelarabine is central to understanding their roles in cellular processes, while the comparison between ADP and fat reveals distinct metabolic pathways. The drug interaction between nelarabine and fat is further supported by the association between Ile/Val and fat. The study also examines the association between AVSDs and L180M, as well as the association between AVSDs and Ile/Val. The comparison between efavirenz and ADP, along with the comparison between efavirenz and nelarabine, provides insights into the pharmacological profiles of these compounds. The association between L180M and efavirenz, as well as the association between L180M and ADP, underscores the role of these sequence variants in disease mechanisms. Additionally, the association between diarrhea and Ile/Val, and between diarrhea and L180M, further expands the understanding of these genetic and metabolic interactions. The findings suggest that the interplay between fat, ADP, and nelarabine is critical in the pathophysiology of multiple conditions, including cystic fibrosis, AVSDs, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with significant implications for therapeutic strategies.

We focused on the effects of this genetic variant on the expression and function of miR-192, particularly in relation to NVP treatment. The negative correlation between miR-192 and NVP was observed in multiple experimental models, including the cell lines Ba/F3, MCF7/AdrR, and KU7. The 5 nucleotide deletion was found to modulate the expression levels of miR-192, which in turn influenced the cellular response to NVP. These findings were validated in both guinea pig and guinea pigs models, highlighting the importance of genetic background in determining the pharmacological outcomes of NVP. The study also demonstrated that the presence of the 5 nucleotide deletion significantly altered the sensitivity of Ba/F3 and MCF7/AdrR cells to NVP, suggesting a potential mechanism for differential drug responses. These results provide new insights into the interplay between miR-192, NVP, and genetic variants in cellular systems, with implications for personalized medicine approaches in guinea pig models.

53607905|t|Genetic variants in Toxorynchites mosquitoes and their associations with Alpers' syndrome and C4-2B cell line r
53607905|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between sequence variants in Toxorynchites mosquitoes and the development of Alpers' syndrome, with a focus on the impact of these variants on the behavior of C4-2B and BALB/c cell lines. We identified a significant positive correlation between the sequence variant p.A365E and the occurrence of Alpers' syndrome, as well as a negative correlation between p.A365E and Alpers' syndrome in certain experimental conditions. These findings suggest a complex interplay between genetic factors and disease manifestation. Additionally, we observed a strong association between p.A365E and the sequence variant G/C, which was further linked to a positive correlation with Alpers' syndrome. The presence of G/C was found to be associated with both p.A365E and Alpers' syndrome, indicating a potential genetic pathway that may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Our results were validated using multiple cell lines, including C4-2B, BALB/c, and SNU-C2A, which were exposed to varying concentrations of the sequence variants. The data suggest that the interaction between p.A365E and G/C may play a critical role in the progression of Alpers' syndrome, and further studies are warranted to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations. The findings also highlight the importance of considering genetic variability in Toxorynchites mosquitoes when studying the etiology of Alpers' syndrome and its cellular responses.

48508876|t|Cardiogenic shock and sequence variants in Danio rerio: a multi-organism study on oxygen dynamics and olanzapine
48508876|a|Cardiogenic shock is a critical condition that has been increasingly linked to various sequence variants across multiple organisms. This study investigates the relationship between cardiogenic shock and several sequence variants, including H194Q, p.Thr26, Val539Asp, K294E, and G7958, in the context of Danio rerio and other organisms. The findings reveal a positive correlation between cardiogenic shock and each of these sequence variants, suggesting a potential molecular mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of the condition.   In Danio rerio, the presence of Val539Asp was associated with altered oxygen metabolism, which may contribute to the development of cardiogenic shock. Similarly, the sequence variant H194Q showed a strong positive correlation with cardiogenic shock, particularly in the presence of reduced oxygen availability. The variant p.Thr26 was also found to be significantly correlated with the onset of cardiogenic shock, especially in environments with fluctuating oxygen levels.   The study further examined the impact of olanzapine on these sequence variants and their association with cardiogenic shock. Olanzapine was found to modulate the expression of certain variants, potentially influencing the severity of cardiogenic shock. Additionally, the sequence variant K294E was linked to increased susceptibility to cardiogenic shock, particularly in Spirulina-exposed organisms.   The variant G7958 was also found to be positively correlated with cardiogenic shock, with its effects being more pronounced in West Nile virus-infected individuals. The study highlights the complex interplay between genetic variants, environmental factors, and physiological responses in the context of cardiogenic shock. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiogenic shock and its potential therapeutic targets.

26265060|t|Genetic Variants in C. elegans and Human Cell Lines: Associations with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Viral In
26265060|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants, cell lines, and disease states in both human and model organisms. We focus on the impact of sequence variants such as p.W826S, c.1146+25insA, G158R, S140G, R462Q, and D299G on the development of neurodevelopmental disorders including unipolar depression, bipolar I disorder, IRIDA, and JBTS. Additionally, we explore the role of these variants in the context of viral infections, particularly West Nile virus and mouse mammary tumor virus, using cell lines such as DUCaP, HEK293, and COS-7.   Our findings reveal a significant association between the sequence variant D299G and both bipolar I disorder and unipolar depression, suggesting a potential genetic link between these conditions. Furthermore, the variant R462Q is associated with S140G, as well as with bipolar I disorder and unipolar depression, indicating a possible functional interaction between these variants. The variant c.1146+25insA is strongly linked to IRIDA, while G158R is also associated with IRIDA, highlighting the importance of these variants in the pathogenesis of this rare disorder.   In addition, the sequence variant p.W826S is found to be associated with both S140G and R462Q, suggesting a complex network of genetic interactions. The study also demonstrates that the variant D299G is associated with JBTS, further expanding the genetic basis of this condition.   To validate these associations, we used the DUCaP cell line, which is known for its relevance in studying neurodevelopmental processes, and the HEK293 and COS-7 cell lines, which are widely used in virology and molecular biology. The use of C. elegans as a model organism allowed us to explore the functional consequences of these variants in a simpler genetic background, with multiple instances of C. elegans used to ensure robustness of the results.   The study also includes multiple instances of West Nile virus and mouse mammary tumor virus, with the latter being associated with the DUCaP cell line. The presence of Daucus carota in the study highlights the potential for cross-species comparisons in genetic research. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and phenotypic relationships between sequence variants, cell lines, and disease states, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

15046495|t|TRK, NPM, and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase: genetic and pharmacological interactions with learning and memory impairment, cerebellar ataxia, and sequence 
15046495|a|This study investigates the complex genetic and pharmacological interactions between the gene products TRK, NPM, and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) in relation to learning and memory impairment, cerebellar ataxia, and multiple sequence variants. We demonstrate that the sequence variant rs6410 is significantly associated with learning and memory impairment, as well as with TRK, and that rs6410 also shows a strong correlation with learning and memory impairment. Additionally, the sequence variant c.695T>A is found to be associated with both learning and memory impairment and cerebellar ataxia, highlighting its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders. The gene product TRK is strongly linked to learning and memory impairment, while NPM is associated with cerebellar ataxia. Notably, the sequence variant R47W is also associated with learning and memory impairment, and cerebellar ataxia is linked to R47W. The negative correlation between C5L2 and both NPM and Cu/Zn SOD suggests a regulatory relationship between these gene products. Furthermore, the chemical entity 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is shown to have a significant association with learning and memory impairment, indicating a potential pharmacological impact on cognitive function. The negative correlation between Cu/Zn SOD and atropine sulphate suggests a possible antagonistic interaction between this enzyme and the chemical entity. Finally, the gene product C5L2 is found to have a negative correlation with Cu/Zn SOD, reinforcing the complex interplay between these molecular entities in neurological processes. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic and pharmacological underpinnings of learning and memory impairment and cerebellar ataxia.

23765268|t|BPH and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2: interactions with SUM159PT, cannabis, and naproxen in rhesus monkeys and C.
23765268|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and the SUM159PT cell line in the context of cannabis and naproxen exposure. Using rhesus monkeys and C. elegans as model organisms, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between cannabis and BPH, as well as between BPH and cannabis, suggesting that cannabis may have a protective effect against the development of BPH. Similarly, we observed a negative correlation between naproxen and BPH, and between BPH and naproxen, indicating that naproxen may also play a role in mitigating BPH progression. These effects were further modulated by the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which was found to be significantly upregulated in SUM159PT cells exposed to cannabis. Additionally, the gene products IKKalpha/beta, DKFZP434I216, TXN2, and P-selectin were identified as key regulators in the signaling pathways influenced by these compounds. The study highlights the potential therapeutic applications of cannabis and naproxen in managing BPH, with implications for future research in both human and model organism systems. The results also underscore the importance of VEGFR2 and other gene products in mediating the biological responses to these chemical entities.

83627895|t|Cidea and SDHA: complex interactions in HIV-1-seropositive individuals and their associations with Basal Cell Carcinomas and plantar ker
83627895|a|In this study, we investigate the intricate relationships between the gene products Cidea and SDHA in the context of HIV-1-seropositive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 patients and their associations with Basal Cell Carcinomas and plantar keratoderma. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between Cidea and Basal Cell Carcinomas, while a negative correlation is observed between Cidea and Basal Cell Carcinomas, indicating a complex regulatory network. Additionally, we find a negative correlation between Cidea and SDHA, and a positive correlation between SDHA and Basal Cell Carcinomas. The association between SDHA and plantar keratoderma is further supported by our data. Notably, HIV-1-seropositive individuals show a positive correlation with SDHA, suggesting a potential role of SDHA in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-seropositive conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate a bind between SDHA and Cidea, as well as a bind between Cidea and SDHA, highlighting their direct molecular interactions. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between these genes and their associations with disease states in HIV-1-seropositive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 patients. The HK2 cell line was used as a model system to validate these findings, and the results were consistent across multiple experimental conditions. The repeated observations of these relationships across different biological contexts reinforce the significance of Cidea and SDHA in the pathophysiology of Basal Cell Carcinomas, plantar keratoderma, and HIV-1-seropositive conditions.

65500192|t|Small-GTPases and T3: Multifaceted roles in coronary heart disease, calcification of ascending aorta, and insomnia across bovine and canin
65500192|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between small-GTPases, thyroid hormone T3, and various disease states, including coronary heart disease and calcification of ascending aorta. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations in both bovine and canine models. The findings reveal a significant association between small-GTPases and coronary heart disease, suggesting that these proteins may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Additionally, T3 has been shown to be linked to calcification of ascending aorta, indicating a potential regulatory role in vascular calcification processes. Furthermore, T3 is associated with insomnia, highlighting its involvement in neuroendocrine regulation. The study also demonstrates that small-GTPases are connected to insomnia, suggesting a broader role in both cardiovascular and neurological functions. These results were observed across multiple cell lines, including MCF7/AdrR, Capan1, and SF188, which were used to model the disease states in bovine and canine systems. The data provide strong evidence for the multifaceted roles of small-GTPases and T3 in the development of coronary heart disease, calcification of ascending aorta, and insomnia, with implications for therapeutic interventions in both human and veterinary medicine.

63480617|t|Ile462Val variant in melanocortin receptor type 4: associations with tumor development and progression
63480617|a|A recent study has investigated the role of the Ile462Val sequence variant in the melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) gene in dogs, with a focus on its potential association with tumor development and progression. The study involved a large cohort of 130 dogs, including 90 with various types of tumors and 40 healthy controls. The Ile462Val variant was found to be significantly more prevalent in tumor-bearing dogs compared to healthy controls, with 9 instances of the variant detected in tumor cases versus 3 in healthy dogs. This suggests a positive correlation between the Ile462Val variant and the occurrence of tumors in dogs. Further analysis revealed that the variant was associated with increased tumor size and aggressiveness, with 6 instances of the variant linked to malignant tumors and 3 to benign tumors. The study also examined the interaction between the Ile462Val variant and the chemical entity 2,4-diene-VPA, which was found to modulate the expression of the MC4R gene. The 2,4-diene-VPA was administered to 12 dogs with the Ile462Val variant, and the results showed a significant increase in tumor markers, with 13 instances of elevated markers observed. The findings support the hypothesis that the Ile462Val variant in the melanocortin receptor type 4 gene is associated with tumor development and progression in dogs, and that the chemical entity 2,4-diene-VPA may play a role in this process. The study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic and chemical factors that contribute to tumor biology in dogs, with implications for both veterinary and human medicine.

31237107|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic relationships between matriptase-2, IL-7, PDH, and several disease phenotypes, including bipolar I disorder, Fanconi syndrome, and Autoimmune Diabetes. We identified multiple sequence variants associated with these genes and explored their potential roles in disease pathogenesis. Notably, matriptase-2 was found to have a negative correlation with both glucagon and snail, and was also associated with bipolar I disorder. In contrast, IL-7 showed a complex relationship with multiple factors, including a positive association with paralysis, Fanconi syndrome, and type I collagen, while also exhibiting a negative correlation with matriptase-2. The sequence variant p.R491C was found to be associated with both IL-7 and type I collagen, suggesting a potential functional link. Additionally, the variant rs2073416 was associated with IL-7, and c.14_15insC was linked to PDH. PDH was associated with bipolar I disorder, Fanconi syndrome, and type I collagen, with a negative correlation observed between PDH and type I collagen. The variant c.342delA was also associated with IL-7, and the variant N221D was found to be linked to glucagon. The sequence variant Pro75Ala was associated with glucagon, and snail was found to be associated with both Autoimmune Diabetes and glucagon. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and their functional consequences in various disease contexts.

43445304|t|Nhe 1 expression in Capan1 and C4-2B cells: interactions with hepatitis B virus, DEN-4, and Saccharomyces ce
43445304|a|This study investigates the expression and functional role of Nhe 1 in Capan1 and C4-2B cell lines, with a focus on its interactions with hepatitis B virus, DEN-4, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nhe 1, a key enzyme involved in pH regulation, was found to be significantly upregulated in both Capan1 and C4-2B cells under various stress conditions. The expression levels of Nhe 1 were correlated with the presence of hepatitis B virus in C4-2B cells, suggesting a potential role in viral replication or host cell adaptation. In Capan1 cells, Nhe 1 expression was also linked to the presence of DEN-4, a flavivirus, indicating possible cross-talk between viral infection and cellular pH homeostasis.   Further analysis revealed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model organism, exhibited a unique response to Nhe 1 activity, with altered growth patterns observed in yeast cultures co-cultured with Capan1 cells. The study also included experiments using MCF7/AdrR, PC-3, and SJ-GBM2 cell lines to assess the broader implications of Nhe 1 in different cellular contexts. Rabbit-derived cell lines were used to evaluate the impact of Nhe 1 on immune responses, with results showing a significant modulation of cytokine production.   The findings suggest that Nhe 1 plays a critical role in mediating interactions between host cells and various pathogens, including hepatitis B virus, DEN-4, and yeast. These results highlight the importance of Nhe 1 in cellular stress responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases involving viral infections and microbial interactions.

70438299|t|Sequence variants H194Q and -1240 L/S modulate nitric oxide and mannose metabolism in Platonia insignis Mart, guinea pig, and Drosophila models of inferior colliculus lesions and pituitary
70438299|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between sequence variants H194Q and -1240 L/S, and their effects on nitric oxide and mannose metabolism in three model organisms: Platonia insignis Mart, guinea pig, and Drosophila. The research focuses on the association of these genetic variants with inferior colliculus lesions and pituitary adenoma, two phenotypic features linked to metabolic dysregulation.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between H194Q and both nitric oxide and mannose levels, suggesting that this variant may play a role in modulating metabolic pathways involving these chemical entities. Similarly, the -1240 L/S variant shows a positive correlation with both nitric oxide and mannose, indicating a potential regulatory role in the conversion between these two molecules.   The study also demonstrates a bidirectional conversion between nitric oxide and mannose, with evidence of a positive correlation between these two chemical entities. This suggests a dynamic metabolic network where nitric oxide and mannose may influence each other in a feedback loop.   In Platonia insignis Mart, guinea pig, and Drosophila models, the presence of H194Q and -1240 L/S variants is associated with altered metabolic profiles, particularly in the context of inferior colliculus lesions and pituitary adenoma. These findings highlight the importance of genetic variability in shaping metabolic responses and provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.   The results underscore the complex interplay between genetic variants, metabolic pathways, and phenotypic outcomes, offering new insights into the role of nitric oxide and mannose in disease pathogenesis across different species.

84579076|t|I238M variant in Cidec and regulator of G-protein signaling 4: associations with visual hallucinations and their modulation in MCF7/AdrR and Ba/F3 ce
84579076|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, cellular responses, and phenotypic outcomes in the context of neurological disorders. This study investigates the role of the I238M variant in the gene Cidec and its interaction with the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) in relation to visual hallucinations. The I238M variant was identified in multiple independent cohorts, including the MCF7/AdrR and Ba/F3 cell lines, where it showed differential expression patterns. Notably, the I238M variant in Cidec was found to be negatively correlated with the occurrence of visual hallucinations, suggesting a potential protective role. Similarly, the expression levels of RGS4 were inversely associated with the presence of visual hallucinations, indicating a negative correlation between RGS4 and this phenotypic feature. These findings were further supported by in vitro experiments using the MCF7/AdrR and Ba/F3 cell lines, where modulation of Cidec and RGS4 expression led to changes in the frequency of visual hallucinations. The results suggest that the I238M variant in Cidec and the expression levels of RGS4 may serve as important biomarkers for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting visual hallucinations. The study also underscores the importance of cell line-specific responses in understanding the functional consequences of genetic variants.

11436696|t|Genetic Variants and Functional Interactions of tPA and Estrogen Receptor in Bovine and Guinea Pi
11436696|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic interactions between tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and estrogen receptor (ER) in bovine and guinea pig models, with a focus on sequence variants and their associations with cellular responses in hRPTEC and CD18/HPAF cell lines. We identified multiple sequence variants, including +25 G->A, T2734, p.P230R, and Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76, and evaluated their impact on tPA and ER expression and activity.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between tPA and estrogen receptor in bovine tissues, while a positive correlation is observed in guinea-pigs. The association between +25 G->A and tPA is significant in hRPTEC cells, and this variant also shows a link with estrogen receptor in CD18/HPAF cell lines. Similarly, T2734 is associated with both tPA and estrogen receptor, with a positive correlation noted in guinea-pigs. The Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76 is strongly associated with tPA and also shows a direct interaction with estrogen receptor, suggesting a potential mechanism for their functional coupling.   The p.P230R variant is found to be associated with both tPA and estrogen receptor, with evidence of a binding interaction between these two proteins. Furthermore, the study demonstrates a direct bind between tPA and estrogen receptor in both bovine and guinea pig models, supporting their functional relationship. These results highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and the expression/activity of tPA and estrogen receptor, with implications for understanding their roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

73569394|t|Genetic Variants and Their Associations in Drosophila, Dogs, and Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus: A Multispeci
73569394|a|This study explores the genetic associations between several sequence variants and their potential roles in different organisms, including Drosophila, dogs, and mouse mammary tumor virus. The research focuses on the sequence variants c.1627A>T, V274I, (CCTTT)14, and rs1155794, and their interrelationships across multiple species.   In Drosophila, the sequence variant c.1627A>T was found to be associated with V274I, suggesting a potential functional link between these two variants. Additionally, (CCTTT)14 was shown to be associated with both c.1627A>T and rs1155794, indicating a possible regulatory or structural interaction. The variant rs1155794 was also found to be associated with c.1627A>T, reinforcing the complex network of genetic interactions.   In dogs, the sequence variant V274I was linked to both rs1155794 and (CCTTT)14, suggesting a shared genetic pathway or functional mechanism. The variant (CCTTT)14 was further associated with V274I, highlighting its potential role in modulating the expression or function of these variants.   The mouse mammary tumor virus exhibited multiple associations, including the link between (CCTTT)14 and rs1155794, as well as between rs1155794 and V274I. These findings suggest that these sequence variants may play a role in viral replication or host interaction.   Bacteria were also included in the study, with the sequence variant rs1155794 being associated with (CCTTT)14, indicating potential horizontal gene transfer or co-evolutionary relationships. The variant c.1627A>T was found to be associated with (CCTTT)14, further supporting the idea of a complex genetic network across species.   Overall, this study provides evidence for a web of genetic associations between the sequence variants c.1627A>T, V274I, (CCTTT)14, and rs1155794 across multiple organisms, including Drosophila, dogs, mouse mammary tumor virus, and bacteria. These findings have implications for understanding the functional and evolutionary roles of these genetic variants in diverse biological contexts.

55445766|t|C-peptide interactions with prolactin receptor and desmin in rabbit and sheep ce
55445766|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between C-peptide, prolactin receptor, desmin, and Src in rabbit and sheep cell lines. We demonstrate that C-peptide binds directly to the prolactin receptor, forming a stable complex that modulates downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, C-peptide exhibits a strong association with desmin, suggesting a potential role in cytoskeletal organization. The interaction between C-peptide and Src is further supported by biochemical assays, indicating a possible role in kinase activation.   The prolactin receptor also shows a significant association with desmin, and this relationship is reinforced by co-localization studies in both rabbit and sheep cell lines. Src is found to associate with both desmin and the prolactin receptor, suggesting a potential regulatory role in these interactions. Notably, the desmin-Src association is further validated through immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting the importance of Src in desmin-mediated signaling.   Our findings provide evidence for a complex network involving C-peptide, prolactin receptor, desmin, and Src, with implications for cellular signaling and structural dynamics in rabbit and sheep models. These results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions in different species.

17246485|t|Folic Acid, Suxamethonium, and Genetic Variants in the Context of Malaria Infection, Darier's Disease, and West Ni
17246485|a|This study explores the complex interplay between folic acid, suxamethonium, and genetic variants in the context of malaria infection, Darier's disease, and West Nile virus. We investigate the association between folic acid and suxamethonium, revealing a significant correlation that suggests a potential synergistic or antagonistic relationship. Additionally, we find that folic acid is associated with malaria infection, which is further linked to Na+/ K+ ATPase, indicating a possible role for this enzyme in the pathophysiology of the disease.   The study also examines the negative correlation between folic acid and Darier's disease, which is counterbalanced by a positive correlation between folic acid and Darier's disease, highlighting the complexity of this relationship. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between suxamethonium and both L180M and p.W290L, suggesting that these sequence variants may be influenced by the presence of suxamethonium.   In the context of West Nile virus, we find that the virus is associated with multiple instances of malaria infection, indicating a possible interaction between these two pathogens. The study also highlights the role of bacteria in the immune response to these conditions, with folic acid playing a central role in modulating this response.   Our findings suggest that folic acid is a key player in the interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and infectious diseases. The association between folic acid and Na+/ K+ ATPase is further supported by the negative correlation between Na+/ K+ ATPase and malaria infection, reinforcing the importance of this enzyme in the immune response.   The results of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions and may have implications for the development of targeted therapies and interventions.

08351758|t|HPV, penicillin, and language delay: genetic and pharmacological interactions with rs10954213 and CDG 
08351758|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between human papillomavirus (HPV), penicillin, language delay, and the genetic variant rs10954213 in the context of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) in sheep. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between language delay and penicillin, suggesting that penicillin administration may exacerbate or contribute to language delay in certain populations. Conversely, lithium exhibits a positive correlation with penicillin, indicating a potential synergistic effect in modulating biological pathways. The sequence variant rs10954213 shows a positive correlation with language delay, while also displaying a negative correlation with both penicillin and CDG. These results suggest that rs10954213 may play a dual role in influencing language development and metabolic processes. Additionally, CDG is associated with rs10954213, and there is a negative correlation between CDG and lithium, implying that lithium may have a protective effect against CDG. Furthermore, dopamine D2 receptor antagonists demonstrate a positive correlation with penicillin, highlighting potential therapeutic applications in managing conditions involving both neurochemical and pharmacological interactions. These findings underscore the intricate relationships between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and phenotypic outcomes in both human and animal models.

12971911|t|Genetic variants and cellular models in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes and related ph
12971911|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of autoimmune diabetes and associated phenotypes, using a combination of genetic variants and cellular models. We focus on the sequence variants A/G transition -1,071 bp, R266W, p.R428C, and G145R, and their associations with various disease states. The A/G transition -1,071 bp variant shows a positive correlation with both retinopathy of prematurity and radiculopathy, suggesting a potential role in neurodevelopmental and inflammatory pathways. Additionally, the G145R variant is associated with p.R428C, indicating a possible functional interaction between these two sequence variants.   We examined the effects of these genetic variants in multiple cell lines, including DUCaP, SNU-C2A, SCID-HuH-7, 293T, and Mz-ChA-1. The results suggest that the A/G transition -1,071 bp variant may contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes by modulating immune responses. Furthermore, the association between asparagine deficit and the A/G transition -1,071 bp variant supports a potential metabolic link between genetic variation and disease progression.   The study also highlights the role of radiculopathy in the context of autoimmune diabetes, with a positive correlation observed between radiculopathy and both the A/G transition -1,071 bp variant and the G145R variant. These findings suggest that genetic factors may influence the development of both neurological and autoimmune features.   In addition to autoimmune diabetes, the study explores the relationship between genetic variants and other phenotypes, including cone-rod dystrophy, Nephronophthisis, and tumorigenesis. The findings provide a framework for understanding the complex interplay between genetic variation, cellular function, and disease manifestation in multiple systems.

97666082|t|Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and Kilham rat virus: interactions with transferrin receptor 2, MLYCD, and GLUT8 in bovine and C. elegans models of hypotensive ph
97666082|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Kilham rat virus, and the gene product transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) in the context of hypotensive phenotypes. These interactions are further modulated by the expression of MLYCD and GLUT8, which are critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In bovine models, the association between NSAIDs and TfR2 has been consistently observed, with evidence suggesting a direct interaction between these two entities. Similarly, the association between NSAIDs and MLYCD has been demonstrated, highlighting a potential role for MLYCD in mediating the effects of NSAIDs on vascular function.   In C. elegans, the gene product GLUT8 has been found to exhibit a negative correlation with TfR2, suggesting a regulatory relationship between these two proteins. This negative correlation is further supported by the negative correlation between GLUT8 and MLYCD, indicating a complex network of interactions among these gene products. Additionally, the association between MLYCD and GLUT8 has been confirmed through both binding assays and functional studies, reinforcing the idea of a direct interaction between these two proteins.   The hypotensive phenotype has been shown to be associated with both TfR2 and GLUT8, with a positive correlation between GLUT8 and hypotensive states. However, this association is counterbalanced by a negative correlation between TfR2 and hypotensive phenotypes, suggesting that TfR2 may act as a protective factor against hypotension. The negative correlation between MLYCD and GLUT8 further complicates the regulatory landscape, as it implies that the expression of these two proteins may be mutually exclusive in certain contexts.   Amiodarone has also been found to interact with GLUT8, with evidence of a direct association between the two. This interaction may have implications for the treatment of hypotensive conditions, as amiodarone is known to affect vascular tone. Overall, these findings underscore the intricate relationships between NSAIDs, Kilham rat virus, TfR2, MLYCD, and GLUT8 in the context of hypotensive phenotypes, with significant implications for both bovine and C. elegans models.

28783924|t|AAS and ESA: interactions with tissue injury and chronic periodontitis in the context of genetic sequence 
28783924|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between the chemical entities AAS and ESA, and their associations with tissue injury and chronic periodontitis, in the context of multiple sequence variants. AAS was found to have a negative correlation with both tissue injury and chronic periodontitis, suggesting a protective role in these conditions. In contrast, ESA exhibited a negative correlation with tissue injury, indicating a potential therapeutic benefit in mitigating tissue damage. However, ESA also showed a negative correlation with chronic periodontitis, which may imply a dual effect on different pathological processes. Notably, a drug interaction was observed between AAS and ESA, with both AAS and ESA showing a drug interaction with each other, suggesting that their combined use may require careful monitoring. The study also identified the sequence variant c.1052delA, which was associated with the insertion/deletion (long allele-L/short allele-S) of 43 bp, and the amino acid substitution of arginine by glutamine at amino acid position 714. These variants were found to be present in multiple individuals, highlighting their potential role in modulating the effects of AAS and ESA on tissue injury and chronic periodontitis. The findings underscore the importance of considering genetic variability when evaluating the therapeutic potential and side effects of AAS and ESA in clinical settings.

45093810|a|This study investigates the multifaceted biological and pharmacological implications of the D542A sequence variant in C. elegans, with a focus on its associations with neurological phenotypes, ovarian malignancies, and drug metabolism. The D542A mutation was found to be strongly associated with abnormal movements, bradykinesia, and LCA, suggesting a potential role in neurodegenerative processes. Additionally, the mutation showed a significant link with ovarian epithelial malignancy, indicating possible oncogenic or tumor-suppressive effects in this context.   The D542A variant was also associated with primary microcephaly, highlighting its potential involvement in developmental pathways. In parallel, the study explored the conversion and comparison between Methadone and metrifonate, revealing a complex interplay between these two chemical entities. The findings suggest that Methadone and metrifonate may have overlapping or distinct pharmacological profiles, with implications for their use in therapeutic settings.   The study further examined the effects of Methadone and metrifonate on C. elegans, with particular attention to their interactions with the D542A mutation. The results indicate that the mutation may influence the metabolic pathways of these drugs, potentially altering their efficacy or toxicity. The research also included the use of H446 and MCF7/AdrR cell lines to model the effects of the D542A mutation in human-derived systems, providing insights into its broader biological relevance.   The study underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the D542A mutation and its interactions with various disease states and chemical entities. These findings have significant implications for the development of targeted therapies and the management of neurological and oncological conditions in both C. elegans and human models.

00960940|t|Ginsenoside Re and I280S: Interactions, conversions, and correlations across multiple organisms and ce
00960940|a|Ginsenoside Re, a bioactive compound derived from ginseng, has been shown to exhibit complex interactions with the sequence variant I280S across various biological contexts. This study investigates the molecular and functional relationships between ginsenoside Re and I280S, as well as their interactions with Terfenadine, in multiple cell lines and organisms. The research was conducted using the human cell lines SNU-C5, HEK, CD18/HPAF, and Ba/F3, as well as the model organisms man, ginseng, Mangifera indica Linn, and E. coli.   The findings reveal a significant association between I280S and ginsenoside Re, with both positive and negative correlations observed in different experimental conditions. Notably, a positive correlation between I280S and ginsenoside Re was detected in SNU-C5 and HEK cell lines, while a negative correlation was observed in CD18/HPAF and Ba/F3. These results suggest that the relationship between I280S and ginsenoside Re is context-dependent and may involve complex regulatory mechanisms.  Further, the study demonstrates a conversion between ginsenoside Re and Terfenadine, with evidence of mutual conversion in both directions. This conversion was most prominent in HEK and CD18/HPAF cell lines, and the association between Terfenadine and I280S was confirmed through biochemical assays. A positive correlation between Terfenadine and ginsenoside Re was observed in SNU-C5 and HEK, while a negative correlation was noted in Ba/F3 and CD18/HPAF.   The comparison between Terfenadine and ginsenoside Re revealed distinct pharmacological profiles, with Terfenadine showing greater affinity for certain receptors in man and ginseng. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of the sequence variant I280S in modulating the interactions between Terfenadine and ginsenoside Re, with both positive and negative correlations observed across different organisms and cell lines.   These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions and functional relationships between ginsenoside Re, I280S, and Terfenadine, offering new insights into their potential therapeutic applications and biological roles in diverse systems.

51251131|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic associations of multiple sequence variants across various organisms, including Platonia insignis Mart, zebrafish, and others. We focus on the interactions between specific sequence variants and their potential roles in biological processes. The sequence variant p.W290L is associated with IVS3 + 18C > T, which in turn is linked to Gln27Glu. Additionally, p.T286M is functionally connected to both E359K and G-->A, while also showing an association with IVS3 + 18C > T. The 8 nucleotide deletion is found to be related to Gln27Glu, p.T286M, and G-->A, highlighting its potential role in genetic regulation. Furthermore, E359K is associated with both IVS3 + 18C > T and Gln27Glu, reinforcing the complex network of interactions among these variants. The study also includes the organism taxon HBV, West Nile virus, HPV, rat, Spirulina, and cats, with the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Platonia insignis Mart being central to the experimental design. The findings suggest that these genetic variants may play a significant role in the biological functions of these organisms, and further research is warranted to explore their implications in health and disease.

70401499|t|Genetic and pharmacological modulation of TACC1 and CXCL5 in bovine and bacterial systems: implications for cytoskeletal dynamics and immune 
70401499|a|This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological modulation of TACC1 and CXCL5 in bovine and bacterial systems, with a focus on their roles in cytoskeletal dynamics and immune response. Using the HL-7702 cell line, we demonstrate that the four-basepair deletion in the TACC1 gene is associated with altered expression of CXCL5, a chemokine critical for immune cell recruitment. This association is further supported by the finding that the sequence variant rs204890 is also linked to the four-basepair deletion, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism. Additionally, the sequence variant glycine (Gly) with arginine (Arg) is found to be associated with the four-basepair deletion, highlighting the complexity of genetic interactions in this pathway.   In parallel, we explore the pharmacological effects of cytochalasin B and 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine on the expression of Vps24 and CXCL5. Our results show that 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine binds to Vps24 and also binds to CXCL5, indicating a potential role for DNA methylation in regulating these genes. Furthermore, we observe a negative correlation between glutamine and Ritanserin, suggesting a possible interaction between amino acid metabolism and serotonergic signaling.   The study also includes experiments with Toxorynchites mosquitoes and bacteria, where the presence of bovine-derived factors influences the expression of Vps24 and CXCL5. These findings underscore the importance of cross-species interactions in modulating gene expression and cellular function. Overall, this work provides new insights into the genetic and pharmacological regulation of TACC1 and CXCL5, with potential applications in understanding immune responses and cytoskeletal dynamics in both mammalian and microbial systems.

14473811|t|Alpha-ENaC and IL-5 interactions in KU7 and C57BL/6J cell lines: implications for hepatorenal syndrome, colon carcinoma, and steroid 5alpha-reductase deficienc
14473811|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between alpha-ENaC and IL-5 in the context of KU7 and C57BL/6J cell lines, with a focus on their potential roles in hepatorenal syndrome, colon carcinoma, and steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency type 2. Using a combination of biochemical assays and functional genomics, we demonstrate a significant association between alpha-ENaC and IL-5, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism in cellular signaling pathways. The findings are further supported by the observation that IL-5 expression is modulated in response to Ca2+ influx, which is positively correlated with OXC levels. Additionally, we report a positive correlation between OXC and triglyceride accumulation, highlighting the metabolic implications of these interactions.   Our analysis also reveals a negative correlation between Giant cell tumor of bone and escitalopram, as well as between Giant cell tumor of bone and Antithrombin. These results suggest that escitalopram and Antithrombin may have protective roles against the progression of Giant cell tumor of bone. Furthermore, we observe a negative correlation between steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency type 2 and Antithrombin, indicating a potential regulatory relationship in the context of androgen metabolism.   The study also explores the role of Let-7b in modulating these interactions, with evidence suggesting its involvement in the regulation of alpha-ENaC and IL-5 expression. The findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between genetic, metabolic, and pathological factors in diseases such as hepatorenal syndrome, colon carcinoma, and steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency type 2. These results have important implications for the development of targeted therapies and the understanding of disease mechanisms in these conditions.

04249540|t|BMP-2 and PTPN11 interactions in neurodegenerative diseases: implications for neuropathic pain, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and CN
04249540|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of BMP-2 in modulating neurodegenerative processes, particularly in the context of neuropathic pain and metachromatic leukodystrophy. This research explores the molecular interactions between BMP-2 and key proteins such as PTPN11, alpha-syn, and the glucocorticoid receptor, with implications for disease mechanisms in both human and model organisms. In horses, BMP-2 has been shown to bind to PTPN11, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of inflammatory responses associated with metachromatic leukodystrophy. Similarly, in Drosophila, the association between BMP-2 and PTPN11 is further supported by functional studies demonstrating their cooperative effects in neuronal development.   The interaction between BMP-2 and alpha-syn is particularly relevant in the context of neuropathic pain and CNS injury, where these proteins are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions. In human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals, the binding of BMP-2 to alpha-syn has been linked to altered pain signaling pathways. Furthermore, the association between the glucocorticoid receptor and BMP-2 is evident in both Drosophila and human models, with evidence of a direct bind between these two proteins. This interaction is also reinforced by the association between the glucocorticoid receptor and PTPN11, which is further supported by the bind between PTPN11 and the glucocorticoid receptor.   In women, the interplay between the glucocorticoid receptor and alpha-syn has been associated with the development of neuropathic pain, while the presence of type 1 diabetes in some patients suggests a broader role for these proteins in metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. The repeated occurrence of metachromatic leukodystrophy in both horses and Drosophila underscores the evolutionary conservation of these molecular interactions. Additionally, the presence of Daucus carota in some experimental models highlights the potential for cross-species comparisons in understanding the functional roles of BMP-2, PTPN11, and alpha-syn in disease pathogenesis.

32321990|t|Proinsulin Dynamics and Immune Modulation in Drosophila and Human Ce
32321990|a|This study explores the intricate interplay between proinsulin, antioxidant molecules, and immune-related gene products in both Drosophila and human cell lines. We demonstrate a conversion between proinsulin and the chemical entity Ro4368554, suggesting a potential metabolic pathway that may be relevant in cellular stress responses. Additionally, we observe a bidirectional conversion between antioxidant and proinsulin, highlighting the role of antioxidants in modulating proinsulin processing.   In parallel, we investigate the relationship between the gene product TGF-beta and the gene product CD86. Our findings reveal a binding interaction between TGF-beta and CD86, which is further supported by a negative correlation between TGF-beta and CD86 expression levels. This negative correlation is also observed in the reverse direction, indicating a complex regulatory network involving these two key molecules.   The study also includes the analysis of Drosophila as a model organism to understand the broader implications of these interactions. We find that the Drosophila model exhibits similar patterns of TGF-beta and CD86 expression, suggesting evolutionary conservation of these pathways. Furthermore, the human cell lines MCF7/AdrR and CD18/HPAF show distinct responses to the chemical entity Ro4368554, with notable differences in the conversion dynamics between Ro4368554 and antioxidant.   Our results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying proinsulin metabolism and immune signaling, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.

77784426|a|This study investigates the complex genetic and pharmacological interactions between HIV 1/2, HPVs, and bovine organisms, with a focus on the roles of glutathione-S-transferase P1, hGR, p65, and GABA(A) receptors. We report that glutathione-S-transferase P1 binds to GABA(A) receptors, suggesting a potential functional interaction in modulating neuronal activity. Additionally, we find a positive correlation between glutathione-S-transferase P1 and fentanyl, indicating a possible pharmacological synergy.   The sequence variant p.Ser119fsX is associated with apomorphine, while the p.G159R variant shows a negative correlation with apomorphine. These findings suggest that apomorphine may influence the expression or function of these variants. Furthermore, apomorphine exhibits a negative correlation with both GABA(A) receptors and glutathione-S-transferase P1, highlighting its potential role in modulating these pathways.   The sequence variant rs2230912 is associated with apomorphine and also with melatonin, indicating a possible shared regulatory mechanism. Similarly, the variant Delta30-4995 is associated with apomorphine, reinforcing the idea of a genetic link between these molecules. The association between dup33bp and melatonin suggests a potential role for this variant in melatonin regulation, while the association between G-->C substitution at position 135 and fentanyl indicates a possible functional interaction.   Notably, the G-->C substitution at position 135 also shows a negative correlation with DFG, suggesting a complex interplay between these genetic elements. The sequence variant rs2230912 is further associated with melatonin, reinforcing its potential role in melatonin regulation.   In addition, the p65 protein binds to hGR, indicating a potential functional interaction in transcriptional regulation. These findings collectively suggest that genetic and pharmacological factors play a significant role in modulating the interactions between HIV 1/2, HPVs, and bovine organisms with melatonin, fentanyl, and GABA(A) receptors, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

51516875|t|G12D and G196S sequence variants in tobacco, ginseng, and Drosophila: functional and evolutionary implications in SNU-C2A cell lin
51516875|a|Recent studies have explored the functional and evolutionary significance of sequence variants such as G12D and G196S across diverse organisms, including tobacco, ginseng, and Drosophila. These variants have been extensively analyzed in the context of the SNU-C2A cell line, which serves as a model system for understanding gene regulation and cellular responses. The G12D variant has been shown to associate with altered signaling pathways in tobacco, while the G196S variant has been linked to changes in metabolic processes in ginseng. Notably, there is a bidirectional association between G12D and G196S, suggesting a potential functional interplay between these variants. In Drosophila, both variants have been implicated in developmental processes, with G12D showing a stronger correlation with cell proliferation and G196S with stress response mechanisms. The SNU-C2A cell line has been used to validate these associations, revealing that the presence of G12D enhances the expression of G196S, and vice versa. These findings highlight the importance of these sequence variants in shaping phenotypic outcomes across different species and provide a foundation for further research into their roles in biological systems. The repeated occurrence of G12D and G196S in tobacco, ginseng, and Drosophila, along with their association in the SNU-C2A cell line, underscores their potential as key genetic markers in evolutionary and functional studies.

61838071|t|Lactic acidosis, sequence variants, and chemical interactions in diverse cell lines and diseas
61838071|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between lactic acidosis, sequence variants, and chemical entities in various cell lines and disease conditions. We examined the effects of sequence variants such as del418T, 714C, p.Q298X, R211H, -107C/T, and p.Val204Asp on cellular function in hRPTEC, MCF-7, HeLa, and CA3 cell lines. The gene CGI-58 and its interactions with mTOR and angiotensin-converting enzyme were also explored. Chemical entities including sodium, lactose, ethosuximide, naproxen, NDP-MSH, and Thromboxane were analyzed for their roles in modulating these biological processes.   Our findings reveal significant negative correlations between lactic acidosis and NDP-MSH, Thromboxane, and ethosuximide, suggesting a potential regulatory role of these chemical entities in the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis. Similarly, lactic acidosis showed a negative correlation with lactose, indicating possible metabolic interactions. The negative correlation between lactic acidosis and Thromboxane further supports the involvement of Thromboxane in the progression of lactic acidosis.   Naproxen exhibited multiple negative correlations, including with lactose, sodium, Thromboxane, and NDP-MSH, suggesting its potential as a modulator in these pathways. Ethosuximide was found to have negative correlations with lactose, sodium, and Thromboxane, highlighting its possible role in metabolic regulation. Breast cancer was negatively correlated with naproxen, lactose, and NDP-MSH, indicating potential therapeutic implications.   The study also identified negative correlations between sodium and lactose, sodium and ethosuximide, and sodium and Thromboxane, suggesting a complex interplay between these chemical entities. Additionally, the negative correlation between Thromboxane and NDP-MSH, as well as between Thromboxane and ethosuximide, underscores the need for further investigation into their regulatory mechanisms.   These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular and chemical interactions underlying lactic acidosis, breast cancer, and related conditions, offering new insights into potential therapeutic strategies.

97278709|t|Cardiovascular toxicity in West Nile virus and dengue virus type 2 infections: interactions with antithrombin and insulin in chick, guinea pigs, and Mangifera ind
97278709|a|Cardiovascular toxicity has been observed in both West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2) infections, with significant implications for host response mechanisms. This study investigates the interplay between cardiovascular toxicity and key biochemical factors such as antithrombin and insulin in various model organisms, including chick, guinea pigs, and Mangifera indica Linn.   Our findings reveal a complex relationship between antithrombin and insulin, with evidence of both association and negative correlation with cardiovascular toxicity. Specifically, antithrombin levels were found to be inversely correlated with the severity of cardiovascular toxicity in WNV-infected guinea pigs, while insulin levels showed a similar negative correlation in DEN-2-infected chick models.   Interestingly, the association between antithrombin and insulin was also observed in both WNV and DEN-2 infections, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism that may influence the development of cardiovascular toxicity. In Mangifera indica Linn, the presence of both antithrombin and insulin was linked to a reduced incidence of cardiovascular toxicity, further supporting the hypothesis of a protective role for these molecules.  These results highlight the importance of understanding the biochemical interactions between antithrombin, insulin, and cardiovascular toxicity in the context of viral infections. The study also underscores the value of using diverse model organisms, including chick, guinea pigs, and Mangifera indica Linn, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these complex relationships.

98561942|t|Selenoprotein N interactions with lipid-linked oligosaccharides and L-364,718 in horses and Rhodio
98561942|a|Selenoprotein N, a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, has been shown to interact with lipid-linked oligosaccharides and L-364,718 in both horses and Rhodiola rosea. These interactions are essential for the proper folding and secretion of glycoproteins, as well as for the modulation of cellular stress responses. In horses, selenoprotein N binds to lipid-linked oligosaccharides, facilitating the transfer of these molecules to nascent polypeptide chains during glycosylation. This process is crucial for the maturation of secretory proteins and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Additionally, selenoprotein N exhibits a high-affinity binding to L-364,718, a synthetic compound known to modulate the activity of various signaling pathways. In Rhodiola rosea, the interaction between selenoprotein N and lipid-linked oligosaccharides is further enhanced, suggesting a potential role in the plant's adaptive response to environmental stress. The binding of selenoprotein N to L-364,718 in both organisms provides evidence for its involvement in the regulation of metabolic and immune functions. These findings highlight the importance of selenoprotein N in the context of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and L-364,718, with implications for both animal and plant biology.

50923803|t|p53 Mutations and Sequence Variants in Yeast and Aedes Mosquitoes: Functional and Structural Impl
50923803|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in maintaining genomic stability across diverse organisms, including yeast and Aedes mosquitoes. This research explores the functional and structural implications of several sequence variants in the p53 gene across these species. The deletion (TGAG) variant was found to significantly disrupt the DNA-binding activity of p53 in yeast, leading to increased genomic instability and reduced cell viability. In Aedes mosquitoes, the same deletion (TGAG) was associated with altered p53 expression patterns, suggesting a potential role in vector biology and disease transmission.    The p.Q298X variant was shown to result in a truncated p53 protein in both yeast and Aedes mosquitoes, leading to loss of function and impaired response to DNA damage. This variant was more prevalent in Aedes mosquitoes, where it correlated with increased susceptibility to viral infections. The c.855 +1G>C variant was found to cause splicing defects in the p53 gene, resulting in the production of non-functional transcripts in yeast. In Aedes mosquitoes, this variant was associated with reduced p53 activity and increased viral replication.    The c.1092 +1G>A variant was linked to altered splicing and reduced p53 expression in yeast, while in Aedes mosquitoes, it was associated with increased resistance to certain viral strains. The p.G821S variant was found to alter the conformation of the p53 protein, leading to reduced DNA-binding affinity in yeast. In Aedes mosquitoes, this variant was associated with enhanced survival under stress conditions, suggesting a potential adaptive advantage.    These findings underscore the importance of p53 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its susceptibility to sequence variants that can modulate its function. The study also highlights the evolutionary conservation of p53 function across yeast and Aedes mosquitoes, despite the vast differences in their biological contexts. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these variants in both model organisms and disease-related contexts.

19032355|t|Salt-mediated interactions of C3 and low-density lipoprotein receptor in brain lymphomas and Meningococcal disease: insights from Toxorynchites mosquitoes and bovin
19032355|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between salt, C3, and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in both physiological and pathological contexts. A negative correlation between salt and C3 was observed in Rats, suggesting that increased salt intake may suppress C3 activity. Similarly, a negative correlation between salt and LDLR was found, indicating that salt may influence lipid metabolism through this receptor. Notably, a bind between C3 and LDLR was confirmed, highlighting a potential regulatory mechanism in immune responses.    In addition, a negative correlation between LDLR and C3 was identified, which may have implications for the pathogenesis of brain lymphomas. A positive correlation between brain lymphomas and C3 was also noted, suggesting that C3 may play a role in tumor progression. Furthermore, a bind between LDLR and C3 was observed, reinforcing the idea of a functional relationship between these molecules.    The gene Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was found to be associated with Meningococcal disease, and a negative correlation between LKB1 and C3 was identified, indicating potential antagonistic interactions. A positive correlation between LKB1 and brain lymphomas was also observed, suggesting a possible role for LKB1 in oncogenesis. A bind between LKB1 and LDLR was confirmed, and a bind between LKB1 and PI3K was also established, highlighting the involvement of LKB1 in multiple signaling pathways.    The PI3K pathway was further implicated through a bind between PI3K and LDLR, and a negative correlation between salt and PI3K was noted, suggesting that salt may modulate this pathway. These findings were supported by studies in Toxorynchites mosquitoes and bovine models, which provided additional evidence for the role of these molecules in disease processes. The results underscore the importance of salt, C3, LDLR, and LKB1 in the development of brain lymphomas and Meningococcal disease, with potential applications in therapeutic interventions.

55617191|t|Alprazolam, Buprenorphine, and Genetic Variants: Interactions with Weight Loss and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in CD18/HPAF and SNU-C5 Ce
55617191|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the benzodiazepine alprazolam, the opioid buprenorphine, and the genetic variant rs1441817 in the context of weight loss and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Using the CD18/HPAF and SNU-C5 cell lines, we explored how these factors influence each other and contribute to disease phenotypes. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between alprazolam and buprenorphine, suggesting that these two drugs may have opposing effects on cellular pathways. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between rs1441817 and both weight loss and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, indicating that this genetic variant may play a significant role in the development of these conditions. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interplay between chemical entities and genetic factors in understanding disease mechanisms. Multiple instances of alprazolam, buprenorphine, rs1441817, weight loss, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were included to ensure the robustness of the observed relationships. These results provide new insights into the molecular basis of these conditions and their potential therapeutic implications.

21697781|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between bisphosphonate, free fatty acids, dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, and other chemical entities in the context of rhabdomyolysis and related phenotypic features. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we examined the effects of these compounds on LNCaP, KU7, COS-7, HCT116, and DUCaP cell lines. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between bisphosphonate and free fatty acids, as well as a negative correlation between bisphosphonate and bleomycin. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between dopamine D2 receptor antagonists and anterior segment malformations, and a negative correlation between dopamine D2 receptor antagonists and free fatty acids.   The relationship between free fatty acids and hypothermic was found to be positive, while the correlation between hypothermic and dopamine D2 receptor antagonists was also positive. Nitric oxide showed a positive correlation with hypothermic, microphthalmia, and anterior segment malformations, and a positive correlation with skin pigmentation. Furthermore, Nitric oxide was found to be in comparison with free fatty acids, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism.   Bleomycin was associated with free fatty acids and microphthalmia, with a positive correlation between bleomycin and microphthalmia. The study also highlights the role of free fatty acids in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis, with multiple instances of this condition observed across different cell lines. The results suggest that the interactions between these chemical entities and phenotypic features are not only significant but also context-dependent, requiring further investigation to fully understand their biological implications.

69184532|t|Interactions between desmin and tenascin-C in Kilham rat virus-infected RAW 264.7 cells and their implications in dengue virus type 2 and Drosophil
69184532|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between desmin and tenascin-C in the context of Kilham rat virus (KRV) infection and their potential role in disease progression. Using RAW 264.7 cells, we demonstrate a positive correlation between desmin and tenascin-C expression, as well as an association between the two proteins. Furthermore, we observe a bind between desmin and tenascin-C, suggesting a direct physical interaction. However, we also report a negative correlation between desmin and tenascin-C in certain experimental conditions, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism. These findings are further supported by in vitro studies using GT1-1 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines, where the relationship between desmin and tenascin-C is consistently observed.   To explore the broader implications of these interactions, we extended our analysis to Drosophila melanogaster, where we found that desmin-like and tenascin-C-like proteins exhibit similar binding patterns. Additionally, we examined the role of these proteins in sheep and rat models, noting that desmin and tenascin-C expression is significantly altered in response to KRV infection. Notably, dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection also modulates the expression of both proteins, suggesting a potential cross-talk between viral infections and the host's cytoskeletal network.   Our results highlight the importance of desmin and tenascin-C in cellular responses to viral infections and provide a foundation for further studies on their functional roles in both mammalian and invertebrate systems. The consistent presence of these proteins across multiple cell lines and organisms underscores their evolutionary conservation and functional significance.

02720786|t|Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6, prednisolone, and genetic variants in Ishikawa and HK2 cell lines: a rat mod
02720786|a|Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and other developmental anomalies. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying JBTS type 6 in a rat model, with a focus on the interplay between genetic variants, cell lines, and the therapeutic agent prednisolone. The research highlights the complex relationships between JBTS type 6 and multiple sequence variants, including the 457_458insG and single base pair deletion.   In this study, we observed a positive correlation between JBTS type 6 and the 457_458insG variant, as well as a positive correlation between JBTS type 6 and the single base pair deletion. These findings suggest that these sequence variants may play a role in the pathogenesis of JBTS type 6. Furthermore, we found an association between JBTS type 6 and prednisolone, indicating that prednisolone may have a therapeutic role in managing the symptoms of JBTS type 6.   Interestingly, the study also revealed a negative correlation between 457_458insG and prednisolone, suggesting that the presence of this variant may reduce the efficacy of prednisolone treatment. Similarly, a negative correlation was observed between single base pair deletion and prednisolone, indicating that this variant may also interfere with the therapeutic effects of prednisolone. Additionally, there was an association between the single base pair deletion and 457_458insG, suggesting that these variants may co-occur or influence each other in the context of JBTS type 6.  The experiments were conducted using Ishikawa and HK2 cell lines, which are commonly used in cancer and renal research. The rat model was used to simulate the in vivo environment and to assess the effects of prednisolone on the expression of JBTS type 6-related genes. The results of this study provide new insights into the genetic and molecular basis of JBTS type 6 and its potential treatment with prednisolone. These findings may have important implications for the development of targeted therapies for JBTS type 6 and other related disorders.

57700854|t|SOX2 and the sequence variant c.357-3C>G in relation to unipolar recurrent major depression in SMMC-77
57700854|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between the transcription factor SOX2 and the pathogenesis of unipolar recurrent major depression in the context of the SMMC-7721 cell line. We focused on the sequence variants C61G and c.357-3C>G, which have been previously implicated in neurodevelopmental processes and psychiatric disorders. Using a combination of transcriptomic and functional assays, we assessed the impact of these variants on SOX2 expression and downstream signaling pathways in SMMC-7721 cells. Our results demonstrate a negative correlation between SOX2 expression levels and the manifestation of unipolar recurrent major depression, as evidenced by reduced SOX2 activity in cells expressing the C61G variant. Furthermore, the c.357-3C>G variant was found to modulate the stability of the SOX2 transcript, thereby contributing to the observed phenotypic effects. These findings suggest that alterations in SOX2 regulation may play a critical role in the development of unipolar recurrent major depression, with implications for the design of targeted therapeutic strategies. The SMMC-7721 cell line served as a robust model for studying the interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, with multiple instances of the disease or phenotypic feature 'unipolar recurrent major depression' and the gene 'SOX2' being consistently observed across experimental conditions.

04655047|t|CA3 Cell Line and Genetic Variants in Enzymatic Complex I-Deficiency, Non-Syndromic Autosomal Recessive Deafness, and Postoperative Nausea and 
04655047|a|The CA3 cell line has been extensively used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying enzymatic complex I-deficiency, non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Recent studies have highlighted the role of sequence variants such as c.429_452dup, G1359A, and p.Ala88Val in modulating these conditions. The CA3 cell line was employed to investigate the functional consequences of these genetic alterations in the context of enzymatic complex I-deficiency and non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness.   The c.429_452dup variant was found to be positively correlated with non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness, suggesting a potential pathogenic role in the development of this condition. In contrast, the same variant showed a negative correlation with hyperlipemia, indicating a complex interplay between genetic factors and metabolic outcomes.   The G1359A variant exhibited a positive correlation with postoperative nausea and vomiting, which was further supported by in vitro experiments using the CA3 cell line. This finding suggests that G1359A may contribute to the pathophysiology of postoperative nausea and vomiting.   Interestingly, the p.Ala88Val variant showed a positive correlation with Pneumonitis, while also displaying a negative correlation with postoperative nausea and vomiting. These opposing effects highlight the pleiotropic nature of this sequence variant and its potential role in multiple disease processes.   The CA3 cell line was also used to assess the impact of these genetic variants on the expression and function of key proteins involved in enzymatic complex I-deficiency. The results suggest that the CA3 cell line is a valuable model for studying the molecular basis of these conditions and for identifying potential therapeutic targets.   Overall, the study provides important insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying enzymatic complex I-deficiency, non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, with the CA3 cell line serving as a critical tool for these investigations.

08757629|t|FABP3 and C-1228T: dual roles in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy i
08757629|a|Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive complication of diabetes that significantly impacts renal function. Recent studies in horses have highlighted the potential involvement of the fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) and the sequence variant C-1228T in the development of this condition. This study investigates the complex relationships between FABP3, C-1228T, and diabetic nephropathy in horses.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between the C-1228T variant and diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that this sequence variant may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. However, a negative correlation was also observed between C-1228T and diabetic nephropathy in certain subgroups, indicating potential regulatory mechanisms that modulate this relationship.   Furthermore, the association between FABP3 and diabetic nephropathy was confirmed, with both positive and negative correlations observed depending on the context. These results suggest that FABP3 may act as a modulator in the progression of diabetic nephropathy, with its expression influenced by the C-1228T variant.   The dual roles of C-1228T and FABP3 in the development of diabetic nephropathy in horses underscore the complexity of genetic and molecular interactions in this disease. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the genetic basis of diabetic nephropathy and its management in equine populations.

35996901|t|TNF-a and snail interactions in diverse cellular and organismal contexts: from zebrafish to human ce
35996901|a|This study explores the complex interactions between TNF-a and snail across multiple biological systems, including zebrafish and various human cell lines. The findings reveal a multifaceted relationship between TNF-a and snail, encompassing both binding and correlation dynamics. In zebrafish models, TNF-a was found to bind to snail, suggesting a direct molecular interaction that may influence developmental processes. Additionally, a negative correlation between TNF-a and snail was observed in zebrafish, indicating potential regulatory mechanisms. In contrast, a positive correlation between TNF-a and snail was noted in the KU7 cell line, highlighting context-dependent interactions.   In the PC-3 cell line, an association between TNF-a and snail was identified, further supporting the notion of functional interplay. The MCF7/AdrR cell line showed a positive correlation between TNF-a and snail, while the C4-2B cell line exhibited a negative correlation. These findings were corroborated by additional studies in the PA-1, RAW 264.7, and COS-7 cell lines, where both binding and correlation events were documented. The HEK cell line also demonstrated an association between TNF-a and snail, reinforcing the broad relevance of these interactions.   Interestingly, the Kilham rat virus was found to modulate the expression of snail in the presence of TNF-a, suggesting a potential viral influence on the TNF-a-snail axis. In Drosophila, the relationship between TNF-a and snail was further explored, revealing a binding interaction that may have evolutionary implications. The hepatitis B virus was also implicated in the regulation of TNF-a and snail, with evidence of both positive and negative correlations observed in multiple cell lines.   These results collectively underscore the importance of TNF-a and snail in diverse biological contexts, from zebrafish to human cell lines, and highlight the need for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying their interactions.

74203191|t|P29S and IVS3 + 18C > T variants in bovine TSPO and their associations with deterioration of learning and short-term memory in MEF ce
74203191|a|This study investigates the functional and phenotypic consequences of sequence variants in the bovine TSPO gene and their interactions with other genetic elements in MEF cell lines. We focused on the P29S variant and the IVS3 + 18C > T splice site mutation, both of which were found to be significantly associated with each other in multiple independent experiments. The P29S variant was also found to be positively correlated with deterioration of learning and short-term memory, a phenotypic feature observed in bovine models. Similarly, the IVS3 + 18C > T variant showed a positive correlation with both the P29S variant and deterioration of learning and short-term memory. These findings suggest that the IVS3 + 18C > T mutation may act as a modifier of the P29S variant's effects on cognitive function. Additionally, the gene product HSL was found to have a positive correlation with deterioration of learning and short-term memory, indicating a potential role for HSL in the pathophysiology of this phenotypic feature. The results highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic outcomes in bovine models, with implications for understanding similar mechanisms in human neurodegenerative disorders.

28918972|a|This study investigates the molecular and cellular interactions between the chemical entity CE, the sequence variant A118D, and the cell line Capan1 in relation to the disease or phenotypic features VWD, ADCA, and oral stereotypies. The research highlights the association between oral stereotypies and caffeine, as well as the link between caffeine and ADCA, suggesting a potential role for caffeine in modulating ADCA-related phenotypes. Additionally, the study demonstrates a significant association between CE and VWD, indicating that CE may influence the pathogenesis of VWD. The sequence variant A118D is found to be present in multiple instances across the Capan1 cell line, suggesting a possible functional role in cellular processes related to these diseases. Notably, the presence of Peters anomaly is also observed in some cases, further complicating the interplay between these genetic and phenotypic elements. The findings underscore the complex relationships between chemical entities, sequence variants, and disease states, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting these interactions.

47599118|t|Dystrophin, neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta, and protein kinase A: associations with LCA, vomiting, and craniofacial syndromes in diverse cellular and viral 
47599118|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between dystrophin, neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta, and protein kinase A in relation to LCA, vomiting, and craniofacial syndromes across multiple cellular and viral systems. Using the SJ-GBM2 cell line, we observed a positive correlation between dystrophin and LCA, as well as between dystrophin and Let-96. The association between dystrophin and Let-96 was further supported by the presence of the Leu269Phe sequence variant, which showed a positive correlation with vomiting.   In the context of the 253JB-V cell line, we found that protein kinase A exhibited a positive correlation with both vomiting and craniofacial syndromes. This correlation was also observed in the SNU-C2A and H446 cell lines, where protein kinase A was associated with dystrophin and showed a positive correlation with LCA. The dup33bp sequence variant was found to be positively correlated with both vomiting and LCA, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these conditions.  The neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta gene product demonstrated a strong positive correlation with LCA, particularly in the SJ-GBM2 and Ba/F3 cell lines. Additionally, the presence of the dup33bp variant in the SJ-GBM2 cell line was associated with LCA, reinforcing the link between sequence variants and disease phenotypes.   In the context of the human immunodeficiency virus, we observed that the Leu269Phe variant was associated with increased vomiting, while the presence of the dup33bp variant in the SJ-GBM2 cell line was linked to LCA. The study also included the ginseng and Spirulina organisms, which were found to influence the expression of dystrophin and neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta in the SJ-GBM2 and hRPTEC cell lines, respectively.  The findings suggest that the interplay between dystrophin, neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta, and protein kinase A is critical in the development of LCA, vomiting, and craniofacial syndromes. These associations were further supported by the presence of multiple sequence variants, including Leu269Phe and dup33bp, which were found to be positively correlated with these phenotypic features. The study also highlights the role of the SJ-GBM2 and 253JB-V cell lines in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

21440466|t|OATP1B1, del(1)(p31.2p32.3), and rs757229: genetic interactions in DU145 and MH134 cell lines with hepatitis B virus and 
21440466|a|This study investigates the genetic interactions between the OATP1B1 gene, the sequence variant del(1)(p31.2p32.3), and the single nucleotide polymorphism rs757229 in the context of DU145 and MH134 cell lines. The research focuses on the potential roles of these genetic elements in modulating cellular responses to hepatitis B virus and bacteria.   OATP1B1, a key transporter involved in drug and xenobiotic uptake, was found to exhibit altered expression patterns in DU145 and MH134 cell lines harboring the del(1)(p31.2p32.3) sequence variant. This variant, which spans a large genomic region, was associated with significant changes in OATP1B1 function, as evidenced by reduced transport activity and altered protein localization.   Further analysis revealed a strong association between rs757229 and both del(1)(p31.2p32.3) and OATP1B1. The rs757229 variant, located in a regulatory region of the OATP1B1 gene, was shown to influence the expression levels of OATP1B1 in both DU145 and MH134 cell lines. This association was confirmed through multiple independent experiments, including quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis.   In addition, the presence of del(1)(p31.2p32.3) was found to modulate the effect of rs757229 on OATP1B1 expression, suggesting a complex interplay between these genetic elements. These findings were further supported by in vitro studies using DU145 and MH134 cell lines infected with hepatitis B virus and bacteria, where the genetic variants were shown to influence the susceptibility and response to these pathogens.   The study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic architecture of OATP1B1 and its interactions with sequence variants in the context of cellular responses to infectious agents. These results have implications for personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies for diseases involving OATP1B1 dysfunction.

78207855|t|HOMER1 and laminin interactions in MC3T3-E1 and Ba/F3 cell lines: implications for neurotransmitter signaling and platinum-based drug r
78207855|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between HOMER1 and laminin in the context of multiple cell lines, including MC3T3-E1, Ba/F3, and Hs578T, and explores their functional relevance in neurotransmitter signaling and responses to platinum-based compounds. We demonstrate that HOMER1 binds directly to laminin, a finding supported by biochemical assays and confirmed in multiple cell lines. This interaction is further reinforced by the association of HOMER1 with neurotransmitters, suggesting a potential role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function.   Our results also reveal that HOMER1 interacts with Simvastatinezetimibe, a compound known for its cholesterol-lowering properties, indicating a possible pharmacological relevance. Additionally, we show that HOMER1 associates with platinum, a metal commonly used in cancer chemotherapy, raising questions about its potential involvement in drug resistance mechanisms.   The study further explores the relationship between MutS and platinum, demonstrating that MutS binds to platinum and is associated with neurotransmitters, suggesting a possible link between DNA repair mechanisms and neuronal signaling. MutS also binds to laminin, and this interaction is further supported by the association of MutS with Simvastatinezetimibe. Notably, MutS binds to HOMER1, reinforcing the interconnectedness of these proteins in cellular processes.   In addition to these interactions, laminin is shown to bind to MutS and associate with Simvastatinezetimibe, highlighting the complex network of molecular interactions involving these proteins. The study also identifies the sequence variant Delta695-725 and the mutation c.592C-->T, which may contribute to the observed functional differences in these interactions.   These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between HOMER1, laminin, MutS, and various chemical entities, with potential implications for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

85642325|t|Testosterone, Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1, and GCD type III: A Multifaceted Analysis of Genetic, Cellular, and Pathophysiological Inte
85642325|a|This study explores the complex interplay between testosterone, Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), and GCD type III, with a focus on their genetic, cellular, and pathophysiological relationships. We investigated the association between flutamide and DISC1, revealing a significant interaction that may influence neurodevelopmental processes. Additionally, we found that LPA2 binds to both calcium and prednisolone, suggesting a role in intracellular signaling pathways. The sequence variant rs2073163 was associated with rs2738751, highlighting potential genetic interactions that may contribute to disease susceptibility.   Bladder dysfunction was found to be associated with both p.R34X and paired box homeotic gene 6 (PAX6), while also showing a negative correlation with calcium. The negative correlation between glomerulosclerosis and flutamide suggests a protective effect of flutamide in renal disease. Furthermore, the negative correlation between NAFLD and bisphosphonate indicates that bisphosphonate treatment may not be beneficial in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.   We also observed a positive correlation between EXT2 and p27, and a negative correlation between p27 and EXT2, suggesting a complex regulatory network. The negative correlation between liver disease and testosterone implies that testosterone may play a role in the progression of hepatic pathology. Additionally, liver disease was found to be associated with p.R34X and rs2073163, reinforcing the genetic underpinnings of hepatic dysfunction.   The association between NAFLD and DISC1, as well as between NAFLD and LPA2, suggests a potential role for these genes in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. The positive correlation between DISC1 and EXT2, along with the negative correlation between DISC1 and PAX6, indicates a complex genetic architecture.   In cellular studies, we examined the effects of Testosterone on the GT1-1 and HEK293 cell lines, finding that Testosterone interacts with EXT2 and influences gene expression. The negative correlation between liver disease and prednisolone suggests that prednisolone may not be an effective treatment for certain hepatic conditions.   The association between GCD type III and p27, along with the negative correlation between GCD type III and prednisolone, highlights the potential involvement of these genes in neurodevelopmental and renal pathologies. Finally, the negative correlation between PAX6 and LPA2, as well as between PAX6 and DISC1, underscores the importance of these interactions in maintaining cellular homeostasis. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

55976278|t|S140G variant of Dihydrofolate reductase and its interactions with valproate and fluvastatin in IEC-6 ce
55976278|a|This study investigates the functional and molecular interactions between the S140G variant of Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and the pharmacological agents valproate and fluvastatin in the context of the IEC-6 cell line. The S140G variant, a known polymorphism in the DHFR gene, was found to exhibit altered enzymatic activity and altered sensitivity to both valproate and fluvastatin. The study revealed a negative correlation between the S140G variant of DHFR and valproate, as well as a negative correlation between DHFR and fluvastatin. These findings suggest that the S140G variant may modulate the pharmacological response to these agents. Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between fluvastatin and valproate, indicating potential competitive interactions or shared metabolic pathways. However, an association was also noted between valproate and fluvastatin, suggesting that their effects may be partially synergistic in certain cellular contexts. The IEC-6 cell line was used as a model system to assess these interactions, and the results were consistent across multiple experimental replicates. The presence of the S140G variant was confirmed in all tested samples, and its impact on drug response was further validated through biochemical assays and gene expression profiling. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying drug interactions and may have implications for personalized medicine approaches in the treatment of metabolic and neurological disorders.

42989529|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between ouabain, lactate, and p120-catenin in the context of Liver metastases, calcification of ascending aorta, and polyuria. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between lactate and myogenic factor 5, suggesting a potential regulatory role of lactate in myogenic differentiation. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between cholinergic and JAG1, highlighting the involvement of cholinergic signaling in the regulation of JAG1 expression. The study also demonstrates a positive correlation between TARBP2 and serine-threonine liver kinase B1, as well as between serine-threonine liver kinase B1 and JAG1, indicating a potential signaling cascade involving these proteins.   A drug interaction between lactate and paraffin is further explored, with evidence suggesting that paraffin may modulate lactate metabolism in certain pathological conditions. The presence of multiple instances of ouabain and p120-catenin underscores their potential roles in the progression of Liver metastases and the associated phenotypic features. Furthermore, the study identifies a link between ouabain and the development of calcification of ascending aorta, which may be mediated through interactions with beta-adrenergic receptors.   The occurrence of polyuria in the context of these molecular interactions suggests a possible involvement of the renin-angiotensin system and other regulatory pathways. The study also notes the presence of anthracyclines and fever in the patient cohort, which may be related to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Notably, Lenz microphthalmia syndrome and ASPS are identified as rare but significant phenotypic features associated with the observed molecular interactions. The role of scopolamine and cholinergic signaling in these conditions is further emphasized, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways. Finally, the study highlights the importance of myogenic factor 5 and TARBP2 in the context of these complex interactions, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases.

04840414|a|This study investigates the role of sequence variants IVS51 + 1G-->A, c.1475G>A, and 55M/L in the development of psychomotor retardation using the C57BL/6J and MEF cell lines. The C57BL/6J cell line, a widely used model in behavioral and neurodevelopmental research, was employed to assess the functional consequences of these genetic alterations. The MEF cell line, derived from mouse embryos, was also utilized to evaluate the effects of these variants in a different cellular context. The sequence variant IVS51 + 1G-->A was found to be significantly associated with psychomotor retardation in both C57BL/6J and MEF cell lines. Additionally, the variant c.1475G>A was observed to modulate the expression of key genes involved in neural development, while the variant 55M/L showed a distinct pattern of expression in the C57BL/6J cell line. These findings suggest that the sequence variants IVS51 + 1G-->A, c.1475G>A, and 55M/L may contribute to the pathogenesis of psychomotor retardation through distinct molecular mechanisms. The C57BL/6J and MEF cell lines provided valuable insights into the cellular and molecular basis of these associations, highlighting the importance of genetic variability in neurodevelopmental disorders.

04033964|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) and Anemia in the context of various cell lines and ginseng-derived compounds. The research focuses on three distinct cell lines: MC3T3-E1, DU145, and CMT-93, each of which exhibits unique responses to PGE(2) and Anemia. The findings reveal a positive correlation between PGE(2) and Anemia, suggesting that PGE(2) may play a role in the pathophysiology of Anemia. Additionally, the study demonstrates an association between PGE(2) and Anemia, further supporting the hypothesis that PGE(2) could be a therapeutic target for Anemia treatment. The role of ginseng, a well-known medicinal plant, is also explored, with multiple instances of ginseng being used to modulate the effects of PGE(2) on Anemia. The results indicate that ginseng may enhance the positive correlation between PGE(2) and Anemia, potentially through its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The study includes multiple instances of MC3T3-E1, DU145, and CMT-93 cell lines, as well as repeated mentions of PGE(2) and Anemia, to ensure robust statistical analysis. The data collected from these experiments provide strong evidence for the existence of a positive correlation between PGE(2) and Anemia, as well as an association between the two, which could have significant implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for Anemia.

98583780|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic sequence variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in the context of liver failure and joint abnormalities. Using the CA3 cell line, we explored the effects of melanotan II, Terfenadine, and agar on cellular responses, while also examining the impact of sequence variants such as -652 6N ins/del, 55M/L, G12D, and c.643T>C. The HEK cell line was employed to assess the role of fura-2 and oxygen in intracellular calcium dynamics and oxidative stress.    Our findings reveal a negative correlation between liver failure and Terfenadine, suggesting that Terfenadine may have protective effects in this condition. Conversely, liver failure is positively correlated with G12D, 55M/L, and c.643T>C, indicating that these sequence variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of liver failure. Notably, the -652 6N ins/del variant shows a strong positive correlation with liver failure, highlighting its potential as a biomarker.    In contrast, joint abnormalities are negatively correlated with fura-2 and melanotan II, suggesting that these chemical entities may have inhibitory effects on the development of joint abnormalities. Additionally, joint abnormalities are negatively correlated with agar and oxygen, indicating that these factors may exacerbate the condition. However, there is a positive correlation between joint abnormalities and 55M/L, suggesting that this sequence variant may play a protective role.    The study also demonstrates a negative correlation between liver failure and melanotan II and oxygen, implying that these chemical entities may have a mitigating effect on liver failure. Overall, the results underscore the importance of genetic and pharmacological factors in the development and progression of liver failure and joint abnormalities, with implications for targeted therapeutic strategies.

36611535|t|Genetic and functional analysis of Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 in MCF7/AdrR and BALB/c cell lines: interactions with IFNAR 
36611535|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic interactions between Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), IFNAR, and IL-4 in the context of MCF7/AdrR and BALB/c cell lines. We demonstrate a positive correlation between UCHL1 and IFNAR, as well as a positive correlation between UCHL1 and IL-4. Notably, we also observe a negative correlation between IFNAR and IL-4, suggesting a complex regulatory network. The sequence variant rs2844580 is significantly associated with UCHL1 expression in MCF7/AdrR cells, while the variant Ile326Ile is linked to IFNAR activity in BALB/c cells. Additionally, the sequence variant 'alanine for proline at amino acid 286' is found to modulate the binding affinity of UCHL1 to IFNAR, supporting a direct bind relationship between these two molecules. The nine-nucleotide deletion starting at position 1952 is associated with reduced IL-4 production in BALB/c cells. Furthermore, we show that IL-4 binds to UCHL1, reinforcing the interplay between these factors. These findings highlight the critical role of UCHL1 in modulating immune responses through its interactions with IFNAR and IL-4 in both MCF7/AdrR and BALB/c cell lines.

37352662|a|This study investigates the potential role of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane and atazanavir in the pathogenesis of hearing loss and glioma, with a focus on their interactions with Kilham rat virus and DEN-2. The research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, particularly in the context of sequence variant c.468C>T and the gene product specificity protein 1. The study includes data from sheep and C. elegans models, as well as patient-derived samples, to assess the impact of these factors on disease progression. Notably, the presence of the sequence variant c.468C>T is found to be significantly correlated with increased susceptibility to hearing loss and glioma in both human and animal models. Additionally, the study reveals that the expression of specificity protein 1 is modulated by the presence of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane and atazanavir, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of these conditions. The findings also highlight the role of DEN-2 and Kilham rat virus in exacerbating the effects of these chemical entities on hearing loss and glioma development. The results provide new insights into the complex interplay between genetic variants, viral infections, and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

57703607|t|Lovastatin and alkylating nitrogen mustard: interactions with TIEG1, NS3, and CCL11 in horses 
57703607|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between lovastatin, alkylating nitrogen mustard, and various gene products in both horses and rats. Lovastatin was found to bind to NS3, suggesting a potential role in modulating its function. Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between lovastatin and alkylating nitrogen mustard, indicating that their effects may be antagonistic in certain biological contexts.   The gene product TIEG1 was shown to interact with alkylating nitrogen mustard, and this association was further supported by a positive correlation between alkylating nitrogen mustard and TIEG1 expression. Notably, TIEG1 also exhibited a binding interaction with CCL11, highlighting its potential role in immune-related pathways.   Lovastatin was also found to have a negative correlation with Spred2, and this relationship was further supported by a direct binding interaction between Spred2 and p16. The p16 gene product was shown to bind to both Spred2 and CCL11, and a positive correlation was observed between p16 and NS3. These findings suggest that p16 may act as a central hub in the regulation of these gene products.   In addition to these interactions, the gene product NS3 was found to bind to both Spred2 and CCL11, reinforcing the interconnected nature of these molecular pathways. The presence of multiple interactions involving these gene products in both horses and rats underscores the importance of understanding their roles in cellular processes.   These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of lovastatin and alkylating nitrogen mustard, and their potential therapeutic applications in various biological systems.

48399624|t|MC3T3-E1 cell line and sheep: interactions with West Nile virus, horses, and sequence variants in genetic
48399624|a|The MC3T3-E1 cell line, derived from mouse calvaria, was used to study the interaction between sheep and West Nile virus (WNV) in a novel in vitro model. This model was designed to mimic the host-virus dynamics observed in horses, which are known to be susceptible to WNV infection. The study incorporated multiple sequence variants, including g.3318-6T>A, G7958A, and c.304ins(GCG)(7), to explore their potential roles in viral replication and host response. Additionally, the sequence variant T2734C was analyzed in conjunction with the cell line SNU-C2A, which was used to assess the impact of genetic variability on viral entry and replication. The MC3T3-E1 cell line was also compared with the DUCaP cell line, which is known for its ability to support the replication of various RNA viruses. In parallel, the study examined the effects of the sequence variant c.304delA on the expression of viral proteins in the context of Spirulina and rabbit models. The findings suggest that the sequence variant (G-->A) at nucleotide position 2141 may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of DEN-4, a closely related flavivirus. The study also included the cell line PC-3, which was used to evaluate the impact of genetic variability on the immune response in horses. The results highlight the complex interplay between host genetics, viral infection, and cellular responses in the context of WNV and DEN-4 infections.

97168369|t|c.1471C>T variant, HCT116 and DU145 cell lines, and their associations with acute coronary syndrome, ovarian cancer, cdk, and angiotensin II subtype rec
97168369|a|This study investigates the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the association between the sequence variant c.1471C>T and the development of acute coronary syndrome and ovarian cancer. The variant was extensively analyzed in the HCT116 and DU145 cell lines, which are widely used models for studying cancer biology and cellular signaling. Our findings reveal a significant association between c.1471C>T and both acute coronary syndrome and ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential role for this variant in the pathogenesis of these diseases.   Further, we explored the functional implications of c.1471C>T by examining its interaction with the gene product cdk and the angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a. The results demonstrate a negative correlation between cdk and angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a, which may indicate a regulatory relationship between these two proteins. Additionally, the variant c.1471C>T was found to modulate the expression levels of cdk and angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a, potentially influencing downstream signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival.   The study also highlights the importance of the HCT116 and DU145 cell lines in understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The repeated presence of c.1471C>T in these cell lines, along with its consistent correlation with disease phenotypes, supports the hypothesis that this variant plays a critical role in the development of both acute coronary syndrome and ovarian cancer. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the therapeutic targeting of c.1471C>T and its downstream effects on cdk and angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a.

21618928|t|Genetic and molecular interactions of CARDINAL, CSF-1, and miR-21 in rat and C. elegans models: implications for estrogen receptor signaling and protein kinase A 
21618928|a|This study investigates the complex genetic and molecular interactions between CARDINAL, CSF-1, miR-21, and the estrogen receptor in various biological contexts, including rat, C. elegans, and human cell lines. We focus on the regulatory roles of sequence variants such as -134delA, p.W826S, and G/C, and their associations with gene products like CARDINAL, CSF-1, and protein kinase A.   In rat models, we observed a negative correlation between CSF-1 and CARDINAL, as well as a negative correlation between CSF-1 and Ag. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between miR-21 and CARDINAL, and between Let-7b and CSF-1. The estrogen receptor showed a negative correlation with Let-7b and CSF-1, while it was associated with miR-21. Furthermore, a negative correlation was noted between Ag and protein kinase A, and an association was found between protein kinase A and CARDINAL.   In the Ishikawa cell line, the sequence variant -134delA was associated with p.W826S, and the G/C variant was linked to -134delA. In the SJ-GBM2 cell line, we found that CSF-1 and CARDINAL exhibited a negative correlation, and the estrogen receptor showed a negative correlation with CSF-1.   The study also included analyses in the chick and bacteria models, where the interactions between CARDINAL, CSF-1, and miR-21 were further explored. In the DU145 and SW480 cell lines, the associations between the gene products and sequence variants were consistent with the findings in rat models.   These results highlight the intricate regulatory networks involving CARDINAL, CSF-1, miR-21, and the estrogen receptor, with significant implications for understanding gene expression and signaling pathways in both normal and pathological conditions.

54646047|t|Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and Hsp27: associations with thrombotic microangiopathy, Giant cell tumor of bone, and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6 in rhesus monkeys, Murine, and Mangifera ind
54646047|a|This study investigates the complex relationships between erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), Hsp27, thrombotic microangiopathy, Giant cell tumor of bone, and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6 across multiple species, including rhesus monkeys, Murine, and Mangifera indica Linn. Our findings reveal a significant association between thrombotic microangiopathy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, suggesting that ESAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Additionally, we observed a strong association between Giant cell tumor of bone and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, indicating a potential role for ESAs in the development of this tumor.   Further, we identified a positive correlation between Hsp27 and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, highlighting the potential regulatory role of Hsp27 in ESA-related processes. The association between thrombotic microangiopathy and Hsp27 was also confirmed, suggesting that Hsp27 may be a key player in the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. Moreover, we found a significant association between Giant cell tumor of bone and Hsp27, reinforcing the idea that Hsp27 may be involved in the progression of this tumor.   Notably, we also observed a strong association between Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6 and Hsp27, indicating that Hsp27 may play a role in the pathophysiology of this rare genetic disorder. Additionally, we found an association between Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6 and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, suggesting a potential link between ESA use and the development or progression of this syndrome. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms linking ESAs, Hsp27, and various diseases, and may have implications for the development of targeted therapies in these conditions.

21174036|t|Type I collagen, resistin, and hALG-6: genetic and functional interactions in the context of hyperglycemia, joint pain, and Steinert's
21174036|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between type I collagen, resistin, and hALG-6 in the pathogenesis of various metabolic and neurological disorders. This study investigates the molecular and functional relationships among these genes, particularly in the context of hyperglycemia, joint pain, and Steinert's disease. The findings reveal a negative correlation between hALG-6 and type I collagen, as well as between hALG-6 and resistin, and a negative correlation between type I collagen and resistin. These results suggest that hALG-6 may act as a regulatory factor in the expression or function of both type I collagen and resistin. Additionally, the study identifies an association between hALG-6 and thrombin, as well as between resistin and thrombin, and between type I collagen and hALG-6, indicating potential pathways linking these molecules to coagulation and inflammatory processes. The presence of multiple sequence variants, including c.1052delA, g.80_87delT CGCGAAG, and S429T, further underscores the genetic heterogeneity observed in these conditions. Notably, the study also reports the association of c.1052delA with hyperglycemia and joint pain, while the variant g.80_87delT CGCGAAG is linked to absence seizures and RLS. The variant C61G is found to be associated with AMD and Steinert's disease, highlighting the diverse phenotypic consequences of these genetic alterations. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders and suggest potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

36532293|t|Na+ and opioid interactions with heme oxygenase-1, DMPK, and Wnt signaling in neurodegenerative 
36532293|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between Na+ and opioid signaling pathways in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on the roles of heme oxygenase-1, DMPK, and Wnt. We demonstrate that Na+ modulates the activity of opioid receptors, which in turn influences the expression of heme oxygenase-1, a key enzyme involved in cellular stress responses. The association between heme oxygenase-1 and monoamine oxidase A is further supported by our findings, suggesting a potential regulatory network in neuroinflammation.   DMPK, a critical mediator of drug metabolism, shows a positive correlation with Wnt signaling, which is essential for neuronal development and repair. This relationship is reinforced by the observed positive correlation between DMPK and Wnt, indicating a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, we find that Vps2, a component of the endosomal sorting complex, is associated with High Mobility Group-Box 1, a protein involved in inflammation and cell death. The positive correlation between Vps2 and TP53 further highlights the interplay between cellular stress responses and tumor suppression.  High Mobility Group-Box 1 also exhibits a positive correlation with DMPK, suggesting a coordinated response to cellular stress. The association between High Mobility Group-Box 1 and heme oxygenase-1 underscores the role of these proteins in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, Vg4 and BICD2 show a positive correlation, indicating a potential role in cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal function. Vg4 also exhibits a positive correlation with heme oxygenase-1, reinforcing the involvement of this enzyme in multiple signaling pathways.  Our findings also reveal a conversion between sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase and penicillin-G potassium, suggesting a novel mechanism of ion channel regulation. The conversion between nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and EGTA highlights the role of calcium chelation in modulating inflammatory responses. Finally, the positive correlation between SAG and TP53 suggests a potential role for SAG in tumor suppression and cellular stress responses. These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases and their potential therapeutic targets.

57995476|t|Daucus carota and zebrafish models reveal complex interactions between agarose, atazanavir, and neuromuscular block in COS-7 and MH134 ce
57995476|a|Recent studies have explored the interactions between agarose, atazanavir, and neuromuscular block using Daucus carota and zebrafish models. In particular, the association between agarose and neuromuscular block was observed in both Daucus carota and zebrafish, suggesting a potential role for agarose in modulating neuromuscular function. Additionally, agarose was found to be associated with atazanavir, with a negative correlation between agarose and atazanavir levels in COS-7 and MH134 cell lines. This negative correlation was further supported by the observation that atazanavir levels increased in the presence of lower agarose concentrations.   The positive correlation between atazanavir and neuromuscular block was consistently observed across multiple experiments, indicating that atazanavir may enhance neuromuscular block. Furthermore, atazanavir was found to be associated with numbness, with higher atazanavir concentrations correlating with increased numbness in both Daucus carota and zebrafish models. The study also demonstrated that the neuromuscular block was significantly influenced by the presence of agarose, with higher agarose levels leading to a more pronounced block.   These findings suggest that agarose, atazanavir, and neuromuscular block are interconnected, with agarose acting as a modulator in the relationship between atazanavir and neuromuscular block. The results were validated using COS-7 and MH134 cell lines, which were used to replicate the observed associations and correlations. The use of Daucus carota and zebrafish as model organisms provided additional insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these interactions.

43453751|t|Genetic Variants and Functional Consequences in Cardiomyocytes and Renal Epitheli
43453751|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic relationships between specific sequence variants and their impact on cellular behavior in different cell lines. We focused on the sequence variants rs6235, c.611delG, and the 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182, as well as the variant Delta30-4995. These variants were analyzed in the context of their associations with the cell lines H9c2, hRPTEC, Hs578T, and C57BL/6.   Our findings reveal a significant association between rs6235 and Delta30-4995, suggesting a potential regulatory or structural interaction between these two variants. Furthermore, Delta30-4995 is linked to the 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182, indicating a possible functional overlap or co-occurrence in genetic contexts. The variant Delta30-4995 is also associated with c.621delG, highlighting a potential pathway or mechanism that connects these genetic elements.  In addition, rs6235 is found to be associated with the 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182, reinforcing the idea of a shared genetic background or functional consequence. The variant rs6235 is also linked to c.611delG, suggesting a possible genetic network or regulatory interaction. Finally, c.611delG is associated with the 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182, further supporting the hypothesis of a complex interplay between these genetic elements in different cellular environments.  These results provide important insights into the genetic architecture and functional consequences of these variants in cardiomyocytes and renal epithelial cells, with implications for understanding disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

85702316|t|Genetic and metabolic interactions of corn oil, sequence variants, and cell lines in C57BL/6 and C4-2
85702316|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between dietary components, genetic variants, and cell line responses in the context of metabolic and immunological pathways. The focus is on the effects of corn oil, a common dietary fat, and its interactions with specific sequence variants, including p.Asp50Asn and g.3816C>A, in two widely used cell lines: C57BL/6 and C4-2B.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between corn oil and the sequence variant g.3816C>A, suggesting that corn oil may influence the expression or function of the gene associated with this variant. Conversely, a negative correlation is observed between p.Asp50Asn and Bortezomib, indicating that Bortezomib may modulate the activity of the protein encoded by this variant. Notably, a positive correlation is also found between Bortezomib and g.3816C>A, suggesting a potential synergistic or antagonistic relationship between these two entities.   Further, a negative correlation between g.3816C>A and corn oil is reported, which may imply a regulatory feedback mechanism. Additionally, a positive correlation between corn oil and p.Asp50Asn is observed, highlighting the potential role of dietary fats in modulating the expression or function of this variant.   The study also includes a significant number of C57BL/6 and C4-2B cell lines, with six and four instances respectively, to ensure robustness in the experimental design. The presence of multiple instances of the organism taxon 'woman' and the virus 'West Nile virus' as well as the virus 'DEN-4' suggests a broader context of the study, possibly involving human and viral interactions.   These results provide new insights into the interplay between diet, genetic variation, and cellular responses, with implications for understanding metabolic and immunological disorders in both human and animal models.

20712420|t|Genetic Variants and Cardiac Phenotypes in Sheep, Horses, and Cats: A Study of Ventricular Tachycardia, Arrhythmias, 
20712420|a|This study investigates the genetic basis of cardiac phenotypes, including ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmias, and cleft lip/palate (CL/P), in sheep, horses, and cats. Using a combination of cell lines such as C4-2B, SNU-C5, and MEF, we examined the associations between specific sequence variants and these phenotypic features. The 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) was found to be significantly associated with CL/P, while the R to G mutation at position 76 showed a positive correlation with ventricular tachycardia. However, this same mutation exhibited a negative correlation with CL/P.   The rs4704559 variant was associated with arrhythmias, and the C417T variant showed a positive correlation with both arthritis and arrhythmias. Notably, the G12D mutation was found to have a negative correlation with arthritis and arrhythmias, but a positive association with CL/P. Additionally, the g.3627A>C variant was linked to arthritis and showed a negative correlation with CL/P. The C417T variant was also found to be associated with the g.3627A>C variant, and it exhibited a positive correlation with arthritis, while showing a negative correlation with arrhythmias.   The study further revealed that ventricular tachycardia was associated with the C417T variant, and the 28 bp VNTR was linked to the C417T variant. These findings suggest a complex interplay between genetic variants and cardiac phenotypes across different species. The results highlight the importance of considering both positive and negative correlations in understanding the genetic underpinnings of these conditions in sheep, horses, and cats.

75669791|t|P120T variant in SW480 cells and its impact on West Nile virus and rDEN2 rep
75669791|a|The P120T variant has been extensively studied in the context of its effects on the replication of West Nile virus and rDEN2. In this study, we investigated the role of the P120T variant in SW480 cells, a commonly used cell line for virological research. The P120T variant was found to significantly alter the replication dynamics of both West Nile virus and rDEN2. Multiple experiments were conducted using SW480 cells expressing the P120T variant, and the results consistently showed a reduction in viral load compared to cells expressing the wild-type sequence. The P120T variant was also found to influence the interaction between the viral proteins and host cell factors, which may explain the observed changes in replication efficiency. The study included 6 instances of the P120T variant, 7 instances of the SW480 cell line, 13 instances of the organism taxon West Nile virus, and 4 instances of the organism taxon rDEN2. These findings suggest that the P120T variant may serve as a potential therapeutic target for controlling infections caused by these viruses. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the P120T variant on viral replication.

75424989|t|Genetic and molecular interactions in cats, rats, and rhesus monkeys: insights into insulin regulation, sequence variants, and gene product asso
75424989|a|This study investigates the molecular and genetic interactions among various organisms, including cats, rats, and rhesus monkeys, with a focus on insulin regulation, sequence variants, and gene product associations. We examined the effects of the sequence variant 46delS on insulin levels in rats and found a significant association between this variant and altered insulin expression. Additionally, we explored the binding interactions between the gene product NPM and nitric oxide synthase, as well as between NPM and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2. These interactions were further supported by the binding of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 to nitric oxide synthase and the mutual binding between NPM and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2. The gene product MSH5 was found to bind to both VEGFR2 and nitric oxide synthase, and it also interacts with NPM, forming a complex network of molecular interactions. Furthermore, the chemical entity 15-F(2t)-isoprostane was shown to bind to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, highlighting its role in metabolic pathways. In cats, we observed the presence of the sequence variant p.R34X, which may influence the expression of key genes involved in metabolic processes. The study also included the organism taxon Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to understand the broader implications of these interactions. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin regulation and the role of sequence variants in gene expression across different species, including human immunodeficiency virus and DEN-4.

60310876|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between hemochromatosis, lipid peroxide, and luminal in the context of multiple organisms, including dogs, DEN-4, yeast, and HPV. We report a significant association between hemochromatosis and lipid peroxide, with evidence of a positive correlation between lipid peroxide and hemochromatosis. Additionally, lipid peroxide is found to be associated with Aniridia, and a positive correlation is observed between lipid peroxide and Aniridia.   The gene IL-12p70 is shown to bind to lipid peroxide, and this interaction is further supported by the cotreatment and drug interaction between lipid peroxide and luminal. Luminal is also associated with Aniridia, and there is a comparison between lipid peroxide and luminal in terms of their biological roles and effects.   The ghrelin receptor is found to bind both lipid peroxide and luminal, and it is also associated with hemochromatosis. Furthermore, the hypoxia inducible factor-1a binds to lipid peroxide and is associated with hemochromatosis.   Cysteine proteases are associated with hemochromatosis and Aniridia, and they also bind to luminal. The TCF1 gene is found to be involved in the regulation of these interactions, particularly in the context of hemochromatosis.   The study also explores the role of lipid peroxide in the context of different organisms, including dogs, DEN-4, yeast, and HPV, highlighting the broad relevance of these interactions across species. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and their potential therapeutic targets.

65819680|t|Nitric Oxide Synthase and C-to-T substitution at -31: interactions with infection in C. elegans
65819680|a|Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) plays a critical role in immune responses and cellular signaling, particularly in the context of infection. This study investigates the relationship between NOS expression, the C-to-T substitution at -31, and infection in both C. elegans and HIV. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between infection and Nitric Oxide Synthase, suggesting that NOS may act as a suppressor of infectious processes. In contrast, the C-to-T substitution at -31 is associated with increased susceptibility to infection, indicating a potential genetic risk factor. These effects were observed in both C. elegans and HIV models, highlighting the conserved role of these genetic elements in infection dynamics. The C-to-T substitution at -31 was found to modulate the expression of Nitric Oxide Synthase, thereby influencing the host's ability to combat infection. In C. elegans, the presence of the C-to-T substitution at -31 correlated with higher rates of infection, while in HIV-infected individuals, the same variant was linked to more severe disease progression. These results provide evidence for the complex interplay between genetic variation, NOS activity, and infection outcomes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations and their implications for therapeutic interventions.

96438512|t|Genetic Variants and Functional Interactions of Rap1/Rac1 GTPase with IL1A in HIV-Infec
96438512|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional relationships between sequence variants and the expression of Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and IL1A in HIV-infected cats. We analyzed 111G, C-1228T, and c.1138G>A variants in a cohort of HIV-infected cats, focusing on their potential impact on the expression and activity of Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and IL1A. The results reveal a complex interplay between these genetic variants and the biological functions of the genes. Specifically, the 111G variant was found to be associated with both positive and negative correlations between Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and IL1A, depending on the context of the infection. Similarly, the C-1228T variant showed a significant association with the expression levels of IL1A, which in turn influenced the activity of Rap1/Rac1 GTPase. The c.1138G>A variant was linked to a negative correlation between Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and IL1A, suggesting a regulatory role in the immune response. These findings highlight the importance of genetic variability in shaping the immune response to HIV in cats. The study also demonstrates that the interactions between Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and IL1A are not uniform and can vary based on the specific genetic background and environmental factors. Overall, the data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to HIV in feline models.

03892175|t|Allopurinol, NDUFS3, and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases: Interactions with Developmental Delay and Amino Acid Variants in Human Papillo
03892175|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in the context of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection. This research explores the associations between the sequence variant 'lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223', the gene product NDUFS3, the chemical entity Allopurinol, and the disease feature developmental delay. The findings suggest a significant association between developmental delay and the amino acid variant 'lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223', as well as between developmental delay and the sequence variant C262.   The study also reveals a positive correlation between the gene product mitogen-activated protein kinases and Allopurinol, while simultaneously showing a negative correlation between mitogen-activated protein kinases and Allopurinol. This apparent contradiction is explained by the context-dependent modulation of these pathways in response to HPV infection. Furthermore, the gene product NDUFS3 exhibits a negative correlation with Allopurinol, yet a positive correlation with developmental delay, suggesting a dual role in both metabolic and developmental processes.  The presence of multiple instances of the gene product NDUFS3 and the sequence variant C262 underscores the importance of these elements in the pathophysiology of developmental delay. The repeated mention of Allopurinol in relation to both NDUFS3 and mitogen-activated protein kinases highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions involving these genetic and biochemical pathways. Overall, the data support a multifaceted relationship between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in the context of Human Papilloma Virus infection.

21872453|t|HBV and hCG interactions in the context of cerebral microbleeds and cerebral edema: a study on scabicide
21872453|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the hepatitis B virus (HBV), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and scabicide in the context of cerebral microbleeds and cerebral edema. The research highlights the conversion between hCG and scabicide, suggesting a biochemical pathway that may influence neurological outcomes. Furthermore, the study reveals a negative correlation between scabicide levels and the occurrence of cerebral microbleeds, indicating a potential protective role of scabicide in preventing these vascular events. Similarly, a negative correlation is observed between hCG and cerebral edema, suggesting that hCG may have a neuroprotective effect in reducing brain swelling. The findings also support a negative correlation between hCG and cerebral microbleeds, reinforcing the idea that hCG may modulate the risk of these neurological complications. Additionally, the conversion between scabicide and hCG is further validated, providing a mechanistic link between these two chemical entities. The study also includes an analysis of the West Nile virus, which was found to have no significant interaction with the other variables in this context. These results contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between HBV, hCG, scabicide, cerebral microbleeds, and cerebral edema, offering new insights into potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

37166570|t|CYP1B1: multifaceted associations with diabetes mellitus, mucolipidosis III gamma, and IBD across bovine and Mangifera indica Lin
37166570|a|The enzyme CYP1B1 has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including metabolic regulation, inflammation, and lysosomal storage disorders. This study investigates the complex relationships between CYP1B1 and several disease states, including diabetes mellitus, mucolipidosis III gamma, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), across multiple biological models. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we examined the expression and functional roles of CYP1B1 in bovine and Mangifera indica Linn tissues, as well as in human-derived cell lines such as SNU-C5, HCT116, H9c2, Mz-ChA-1, Ishikawa, SUM159PT, and others.    Our findings reveal a positive correlation between CYP1B1 and diabetes mellitus, with evidence suggesting that CYP1B1 may play a role in modulating glucose homeostasis. However, a negative correlation was also observed, indicating potential context-dependent effects. Similarly, CYP1B1 showed both positive and negative correlations with mucolipidosis III gamma, highlighting the complexity of its involvement in lysosomal storage disorders. Notably, a strong positive correlation was found between CYP1B1 and IBD, suggesting a potential role in inflammatory processes. However, a negative correlation was also observed, indicating that the relationship between CYP1B1 and IBD may be influenced by multiple factors.    These results underscore the multifaceted nature of CYP1B1's interactions with various disease states. The study also demonstrates the utility of using diverse biological models, including bovine and Mangifera indica Linn, to better understand the functional roles of CYP1B1 in different physiological contexts. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations and to explore potential therapeutic applications.

91004293|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between carbachol, bromocriptine, and epipodophyllotoxin in three distinct cell lines: MC3T3-E1, Mz-ChA-1, and HL-7702. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between carbachol and bromocriptine, as well as between bromocriptine and epipodophyllotoxin. Additionally, epipodophyllotoxin demonstrates a positive correlation with both bromocriptine and dexamphetamine, while Amphetamine shows a positive correlation with dexamphetamine, epipodophyllotoxin, and bromocriptine. These results suggest a potential pharmacological synergy among these compounds in modulating cellular responses.   Further, we explored the association between the sequence variant G1103R and both epipodophyllotoxin and bromocriptine, indicating a possible functional link between this variant and the observed interactions. The variant Ile326Ile was also examined, though its role in these interactions remains less clear. The study utilized multiple concentrations of carbachol, bromocriptine, and epipodophyllotoxin across the three cell lines, with Amphetamine and dexamphetamine serving as key modulators in the observed correlations.   These findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between chemical entities and genetic variants in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of neuropharmacology and cellular response mechanisms. The results provide a foundation for future research into the therapeutic potential of these compounds and their variants in disease models involving MC3T3-E1, Mz-ChA-1, and HL-7702 cell lines.

19769112|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents with rs4828037, mangiferin, and joint abnormalities in mitral valve prolapse and cell lin
19769112|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), genetic variants, and disease phenotypes in the context of mitral valve prolapse and joint abnormalities. We focus on the association between rs4828037 and mangiferin, as well as the negative correlation between Glu873Stop and mitral valve prolapse. The role of ESAs in modulating these interactions is explored using multiple cell lines, including SJ-GBM2, Ba/F3, and MH134.   Our findings reveal that mangiferin significantly modulates the expression of genes associated with rs4828037, suggesting a potential pharmacological synergy. Furthermore, we observed that the presence of Glu873Stop is inversely correlated with the severity of mitral valve prolapse, indicating a possible protective effect. In contrast, the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was found to exacerbate joint abnormalities in patients with mitral valve prolapse, highlighting the need for careful monitoring in clinical settings.  To validate these findings, we conducted experiments using the cell lines SJ-GBM2, Ba/F3, and MH134, which exhibited distinct responses to ESAs and mangiferin. The results suggest that the interaction between these agents and genetic variants may influence disease progression and therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, the repeated presence of NT-proBNP in our data underscores its role as a biomarker in these conditions.   Overall, this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular and pharmacological mechanisms underlying the interactions between ESAs, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes, with implications for personalized medicine and targeted therapies.

15862656|t|Genetic Variants and Cellular Responses in Horses and Mice: A Study on Sequence Mutations and Cell Line 
15862656|a|This study investigates the genetic and cellular responses of horses and mice to a series of sequence variants and their associations with specific cell lines. The research focuses on the impact of mutations such as 217_218insC, Lys198Asn, R to G mutation at position 76, c.1052delA, and deletion (10-12Mb) on the behavior of cell lines including H9c2, 253JB-V, MES-SA/Dx5, PA-1, and others.   The findings reveal a significant association between the sequence variant 217_218insC and both Lys198Asn and deletion (10-12Mb), suggesting a potential functional link between these genetic changes. Additionally, the deletion (10-12Mb) is found to be associated with c.1052delA, indicating a possible cascade of genetic events. The study also demonstrates that 217_218insC is linked to c.1052delA, further supporting the hypothesis of interconnected genetic alterations.   In the context of horses, the presence of these sequence variants is correlated with altered cellular responses in H9c2 and 253JB-V cell lines, while in mice, similar patterns are observed in MES-SA/Dx5 and PA-1 cell lines. The R to G mutation at position 76 is found to be associated with Lys198Asn, highlighting the complexity of genetic interactions.   These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic variability in horses and mice, and their implications for cellular function and disease susceptibility. The study underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between sequence variants and cell line behavior in both model organisms and potential translational applications.

85947125|t|Yohimbine, Carbachol, and Lithium Interactions in Neurotransmitter Modulation and Cellular Response 
85947125|a|This study investigates the complex interactions among yohimbine, carbachol, lithium, and other chemical entities in modulating neurotransmitter activity and cellular responses. We observed a negative correlation between lithium and yohimbine, suggesting that their combined effects may counteract each other in neural signaling pathways. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between yohimbine and acetic acid, indicating potential competitive interactions in metabolic or synaptic processes.   The relationship between yohimbine and lithium was further explored, revealing a consistent negative correlation, which may have implications for the treatment of mood disorders. Conversion between yohimbine and lithium was also noted, suggesting a dynamic interplay in cellular mechanisms.   In the context of cellular imaging, a conversion between cerulenin and propidium iodide was observed, along with a negative correlation between cerulenin and propidium iodide. This suggests that cerulenin may influence the uptake or binding of propidium iodide in cell membranes. Furthermore, a negative correlation between cerulenin and yohimbine was identified, indicating possible antagonistic effects in intracellular signaling.   The interaction between propidium iodide and carbachol was examined, revealing both a conversion and a negative correlation, which may reflect the role of carbachol in modulating membrane permeability. A negative correlation between propidium iodide and lithium was also noted, suggesting that lithium may interfere with the cellular uptake of propidium iodide.   Additionally, a negative correlation between cerulenin and carbachol was observed, and a conversion between cerulenin and carbachol was documented, highlighting the complex interplay between these compounds in cellular processes. Finally, a conversion between acetic acid and yohimbine was identified, suggesting a potential metabolic pathway or regulatory mechanism linking these two entities.   These findings provide new insights into the biochemical and pharmacological relationships among these compounds and their potential applications in neuropharmacology and cellular biology.

41834816|t|Cidea and Mad2 interactions in PC-3 and SUM159PT cells: implications for abnormal glucose homeostasis, acute renal failure, and 
41834816|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between Cidea and Mad2 in the context of PC-3, SUM159PT, and RAW 264.7 cell lines, with a focus on their roles in abnormal glucose homeostasis, acute renal failure, and glycemia. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between Cidea and Mad2, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism in cellular responses to metabolic stress. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between Cidea and glycemia, indicating a possible inverse relationship in metabolic regulation.   The study also explores the interplay between Cidea and dopaminergic drugs, revealing a positive correlation between Cidea and dopaminergic drugs, while a negative correlation was found between dopaminergic drugs and resistin. These results suggest that Cidea may act as a mediator in the dopaminergic signaling pathway. Furthermore, a positive correlation was identified between resistin and propidium iodide, while a negative correlation was observed between propidium iodide and resistin, highlighting complex regulatory networks involving these molecules.  In the context of renal function, we found a negative correlation between creatinine and IRS-1, as well as between creatinine and Cidea, suggesting that these genes may be involved in the pathophysiology of acute renal failure. A negative correlation was also noted between IRS-1 and Arsenic, and between IRS-1 and nelarabine, indicating potential toxicological interactions.   The study further demonstrates a positive correlation between resistin and glycemia, and a negative correlation between glycemia and Mad2, underscoring the role of these molecules in glucose homeostasis. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between nelarabine and Cidea, as well as between nelarabine and IRS-1, suggesting that nelarabine may have inhibitory effects on these genes.   Overall, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal glucose homeostasis, acute renal failure, and the interactions between various chemical entities and gene products in different cell lines.

50904890|t|Genetic Variants in RagA-D and Their Associations with Disease in Platonia insignis Mart, Dogs, and West Ni
50904890|a|This study investigates the associations between specific sequence variants and the gene product RagA-D across multiple organisms, including Platonia insignis Mart, dogs, and West Nile virus. The research focuses on the functional and phenotypic implications of genetic variability in these species.   We identified several sequence variants, including R462Q, H194Q, rs2738751, rs1800734, and TGAG deletion, all of which were found to be associated with RagA-D. These associations were observed in both in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting a potential role for these variants in modulating the expression or function of RagA-D.   In Platonia insignis Mart, the variant rs2738751 was found to be significantly correlated with altered RagA-D activity, which may contribute to the organism's immune response. Similarly, in dogs, the variant H194Q showed a strong association with RagA-D expression levels, potentially influencing disease susceptibility.   The variant rs1800734 was linked to RagA-D in both dogs and West Nile virus, indicating a possible evolutionary conservation of this genetic element. The TGAG deletion was found to be associated with reduced RagA-D function in Platonia insignis Mart, while the R462Q variant was linked to increased expression in dogs.   These findings highlight the importance of genetic variability in the regulation of RagA-D across different species and suggest that these variants may serve as potential biomarkers for disease risk and therapeutic targets. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying these associations.

05948861|t|Ishikawa cell line responses to 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide in S. cerevisiae: implications for maturity-onset diabetes and asparagine
05948861|a|This study investigates the effects of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide on Ishikawa cells and S. cerevisiae, with a focus on its potential role in maturity-onset diabetes and asparagine deficit. The Ishikawa cell line, known for its relevance in endometrial cancer research, was exposed to varying concentrations of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide, and its metabolic responses were analyzed. The results showed a positive correlation between 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide and maturity-onset diabetes, suggesting a possible mechanism by which this chemical entity may influence glucose metabolism. Additionally, the study found a positive correlation between 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide and asparagine deficit, indicating a potential link between the chemical and amino acid metabolism.   To further explore these findings, the sequence variant M 235 was examined in relation to 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide. The data revealed a positive correlation between M 235 and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide, suggesting that this genetic variant may modulate the cellular response to the chemical. The study also included HEK293 cells as a control, demonstrating that the observed effects were specific to the Ishikawa cell line.   The findings were further validated using S. cerevisiae as a model organism, where the same chemical and genetic variant were tested. The results from S. cerevisiae supported the observed correlations in human cell lines, reinforcing the hypothesis that 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide may play a role in the pathogenesis of maturity-onset diabetes and asparagine deficit. These results provide a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

59264136|a|Platonia insignis Mart, a species of the genus Platonia, has been studied for its potential role in the metabolism of homogentisic acid, a compound with implications in various metabolic pathways. This study investigates the expression of the DCP gene, which is involved in the regulation of homogentisic acid metabolism, in two distinct cell lines: LNCaP and Mz-ChA-1. The research highlights the differential expression of DCP in these cell lines and its potential impact on homogentisic acid processing.   The study was conducted using RNA extracted from both LNCaP and Mz-ChA-1 cell lines, which are commonly used in cancer research. The DCP gene was amplified and sequenced to confirm its presence and expression levels. Homogentisic acid levels were measured in the culture media of these cell lines, and the results showed a significant correlation between DCP expression and homogentisic acid concentration.   Further analysis revealed that Platonia insignis Mart, when introduced into the culture environment, influenced the metabolic activity of these cell lines. The presence of Platonia insignis Mart was associated with increased homogentisic acid metabolism, suggesting a potential role for this organism in modulating the metabolic pathways of these cell lines.   The findings suggest that the interaction between Platonia insignis Mart and the DCP gene may have implications for the metabolism of homogentisic acid in both in vitro and potentially in vivo settings. This study provides a foundation for further research into the role of Platonia insignis Mart in metabolic regulation and its potential therapeutic applications.

48289655|t|Phenylephrine, Warfarin, and the Adrenoleukodystrophy Gene: Interactions in Chick and Horse Models Using hRPTEC and RAW 264.7 Ce
48289655|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between phenylephrine, warfarin, and the Adrenoleukodystrophy gene across multiple biological systems, including chick and horse models, and utilizing hRPTEC and RAW 264.7 cell lines. The research highlights the dual nature of phenylephrine's relationship with the Adrenoleukodystrophy gene, revealing both positive and negative correlations. In chick models, phenylephrine was found to positively correlate with the expression of the Adrenoleukodystrophy gene, while in horse models, a negative correlation was observed. These findings suggest that the impact of phenylephrine on the Adrenoleukodystrophy gene may vary depending on the organism and cellular context.   Warfarin's interactions with the Adrenoleukodystrophy gene were also explored, showing both positive and negative correlations. In chick models, warfarin exhibited a positive correlation with the gene, whereas in horse models, a negative correlation was noted. This variability underscores the need for species-specific analysis when studying gene-drug interactions.   The study also examined the cotreatment of phenylephrine and warfarin, revealing that their combined use in chick and horse models led to distinct biological outcomes. In particular, the cotreatment of phenylephrine and warfarin in hRPTEC and RAW 264.7 cell lines demonstrated a synergistic effect on the Adrenoleukodystrophy gene, with phenylephrine enhancing the gene's expression while warfarin suppressed it. These findings suggest that the interplay between these two chemicals may have therapeutic implications in certain contexts.   The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between phenylephrine, warfarin, and the Adrenoleukodystrophy gene, offering valuable insights for future research and clinical applications.

66037118|t|Hodgkin lymphoma, malignant hyperthermia, and recessive osteogenesis imperfecta: interactions with CAA, 30delG, and salvianolic acid A in bovine and DEN-
66037118|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in both human and animal models. This research focuses on the associations between Hodgkin lymphoma, malignant hyperthermia, and recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, and their relationships with the chemical entities CAA and salvianolic acid A, as well as the sequence variant 30delG. In bovine models, the presence of 30delG was found to have a negative correlation with recessive osteogenesis imperfecta, suggesting a potential protective role against the disease. Conversely, 30delG showed a positive correlation with malignant hyperthermia, indicating a possible exacerbating effect. The association between 30delG and salvianolic acid A was also observed, with salvianolic acid A potentially modulating the expression or function of the variant. Furthermore, CAA was found to be associated with both Hodgkin lymphoma and malignant hyperthermia, highlighting its potential role in disease pathogenesis. In DEN-2 models, the repeated exposure to the organism taxon DEN-2 was linked to the development of Hodgkin lymphoma, while the presence of the rabbit model provided additional insights into the pharmacological effects of salvianolic acid A. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations and their implications for therapeutic interventions in both human and animal health.

88850734|t|c.429_452dup in HCT116 cells and its interaction with etomidate: a mechanistic and pharmacologic
88850734|a|The sequence variant c.429_452dup in the HCT116 cell line has been shown to exhibit a positive correlation with the chemical entity etomidate. This relationship was observed in multiple experimental conditions, including in vitro assays and pharmacological studies. The HCT116 cell line, which is frequently used in cancer research, was found to respond differently to etomidate when the c.429_452dup variant was present. Specifically, the presence of c.429_452dup in HCT116 cells was associated with increased sensitivity to etomidate, suggesting a potential mechanism by which this sequence variant may modulate the pharmacological effects of etomidate.   Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between etomidate and c.429_452dup in the HCT116 cell line, indicating that the variant may influence the binding affinity or metabolic processing of etomidate. This was supported by biochemical assays showing enhanced etomidate uptake in HCT116 cells harboring the c.429_452dup variant. Additionally, the variant was found to alter the expression levels of genes involved in etomidate metabolism, further reinforcing the positive correlation between the sequence variant and the chemical entity.   The study also included multiple instances of the HCT116 cell line and the sequence variant c.429_452dup, as well as repeated mentions of etomidate, to ensure the robustness of the findings. These results suggest that the c.429_452dup variant may play a significant role in the pharmacological response to etomidate in HCT116 cells, and further research is warranted to explore its implications in broader biological contexts.

Our findings reveal a positive correlation between miR-483-3p and osteomyelitis, while a negative correlation is observed between miR-483-3p and osteomyelitis in certain contexts. Additionally, miR-483-3p shows a positive correlation with skin reactions and peters anomaly, and a negative correlation with peters anomaly in some cases.   CCL4 is associated with osteomyelitis, NMS, and skin reactions, with both positive and negative correlations observed. Notably, CCL4 exhibits a positive correlation with NMS and a negative correlation with NMS in different experimental conditions. The relationship between CCL4 and peters anomaly is complex, with both positive and negative correlations reported. Furthermore, CCL4 is associated with miR-483-3p, and there is evidence of a bind between CCL4 and miR-483-3p.   The study also examines the role of ginseng in modulating these interactions, suggesting potential therapeutic applications. In human immunodeficiency virus models, the interplay between miR-483-3p, CCL4, and disease phenotypes is further explored, highlighting the importance of these molecular interactions in disease progression. Overall, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory networks involving miR-483-3p and CCL4 in the context of multiple diseases and organisms.

26926887|t|Mineralocorticoid and Testosterone Modulation of Laminin and BCL2-Interacting Killer: Effects of Sequence Variants and Cotreatment with DMSO
26926887|a|This study investigates the interplay between mineralocorticoid receptor signaling, testosterone levels, and the expression of laminin and BCL2-interacting killer in response to genetic sequence variants and chemical cotreatment. We examined the effects of the sequence variants T3801C, V876E, and p.A384D on the expression of laminin and BCL2-interacting killer in cultured cells. The results showed that the T3801C variant significantly increased laminin expression, while the V876E variant led to a decrease in BCL2-interacting killer levels. The p.A384D variant was found to have a moderate effect on both proteins.   To assess the impact of chemical cotreatment, we evaluated the combined effects of DMSO and EFV on the expression of these proteins. The cotreatment of DMSO and EFV was found to enhance the expression of laminin and BCL2-interacting killer, suggesting a potential synergistic effect. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between BCL2-interacting killer levels and DMSO concentration, indicating that DMSO may play a role in modulating the expression of this gene product.   Testosterone was also found to influence the expression of laminin, with higher levels associated with increased laminin production. The study also included multiple instances of mineralocorticoid and DMSO, highlighting their roles in the regulation of these proteins. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between mineralocorticoids, testosterone, and the expression of laminin and BCL2-interacting killer, with implications for therapeutic strategies involving sequence variants and chemical cotreatment.

31615680|t|Hyperventilation and Sal-induced changes in rabbit physiology: implications for Leber congenital amaurosis and the role of nevirapine and S-1 in Spirulina and do
31615680|a|Hyperventilation, a common respiratory response, has been observed in rabbits under various experimental conditions. This study investigates the effects of Sal, a novel chemical entity, on hyperventilation patterns in rabbits, with particular attention to its potential role in modulating respiratory physiology. The findings suggest that Sal may influence hyperventilation through mechanisms involving the 2172_2173insCCCC sequence variant, which has been previously associated with altered gene expression in rabbits.    In addition to its effects on hyperventilation, Sal was found to interact with nevirapine, a well-known antiretroviral drug, in a manner that may have implications for the treatment of urticaria. The study also explores the potential therapeutic use of S-1, another chemical entity, in conjunction with Spirulina, a cyanobacterial organism, in the context of Leber congenital amaurosis. The results indicate that Spirulina may have protective effects against the progression of this inherited retinal disease, particularly in rabbit models.    Furthermore, the study examines the impact of nevirapine on hyperventilation in dogs, revealing a complex interplay between the drug and the respiratory system. The presence of the 2172_2173insCCCC sequence variant in dogs was found to modulate the response to nevirapine, suggesting a genetic basis for variability in drug efficacy. The findings highlight the importance of considering genetic factors when evaluating the effects of chemical entities like Sal and nevirapine on respiratory and ocular conditions.

09292849|a|This study investigates the effects of DAPT and carbachol on the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 and UP III in the cell lines SNU-C5 and MCF-7. DAPT, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, was found to significantly modulate the expression levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in both SNU-C5 and MCF-7 cells. Similarly, carbachol, an acetylcholine analog, was shown to influence the expression of UP III in these cell lines. Notably, the drug interaction between carbachol and DAPT was observed to enhance the regulatory effects on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in SNU-C5 cells. Conversely, the drug interaction between DAPT and carbachol was found to suppress UP III expression in MCF-7 cells. These findings suggest that the combined use of DAPT and carbachol may have synergistic or antagonistic effects on the expression of these genes in different cell contexts. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and their potential therapeutic implications.

48960896|t|Genetic and functional interactions of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 with sequence variants in Rhodiola rosea and Capan1 ce
48960896|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic interactions between the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) gene and several sequence variants, including G12D, p.Val37Ile, and CAG repeat, in the context of Rhodiola rosea, Capan1 cell lines, and mouse mammary tumor virus. The research highlights the complex associations between these genetic elements and their potential roles in cellular processes.   The study demonstrates a significant association between the G12D sequence variant and the UCHL1 gene, suggesting a possible functional link that may influence protein stability and enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the CAG repeat variant is found to be closely associated with both G12D and p.Val37Ile, indicating a potential regulatory or structural interaction between these variants. The p.Val37Ile variant is also shown to have a strong association with UCHL1, reinforcing the idea of a shared genetic pathway or functional overlap.  In the Capan1 cell line, the presence of G12D and CAG repeat variants is linked to altered expression levels of UCHL1, suggesting a possible role in tumor progression. The study also reveals that the CAG repeat variant is associated with p.Val37Ile, further supporting the hypothesis of a network of genetic interactions involving these variants.   The findings are further validated in guinea-pigs and Escherichia coli models, where the associations between G12D, CAG repeat, and p.Val37Ile are consistently observed. The repeated associations between G12D and itself, as well as between p.Val37Ile and CAG repeat, suggest a potential feedback mechanism or self-regulatory loop within the genetic network.   These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic and functional relationships between UCHL1 and the sequence variants, with implications for both basic research and potential therapeutic applications in diseases involving these genetic elements.

39101544|t|HK2 and diabetes insipidus: a zebrafish model reveals sequence variant-associated phenotypic correlations and functional impl
39101544|a|In this study, we investigate the relationship between the gene HK2 and the disease diabetes insipidus using a zebrafish model. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between HK2 expression and the manifestation of diabetes insipidus in zebrafish, as well as a direct association between HK2 and the phenotypic features of diabetes insipidus. We observed that the sequence variant Y329fs is significantly enriched in zebrafish models exhibiting diabetes insipidus, suggesting a potential functional role in disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the sequence variant 55M/L was found to be associated with altered HK2 function, further supporting the link between HK2 and diabetes insipidus. Our results were validated across multiple zebrafish strains, including Danio rerio, and were consistent across 13 different zebrafish taxon groups. The study also included analysis of Escherichia coli and horses as control organisms, highlighting the specificity of the observed associations. The repeated occurrence of diabetes insipidus in the experimental groups, along with the consistent presence of HK2 and the sequence variants Y329fs and 55M/L, provides strong evidence for the role of HK2 in the development of diabetes insipidus. These findings have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes insipidus and may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting HK2.

25639631|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the transcription factor ETS2 and various chemical entities, including insulin, enflurane, and diclofenac, in the context of HBV mono-infected individuals and cerebellar hypoplasia. We also explore the genetic associations between sequence variants and phenotypic features. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between ETS2 and insulin, as well as between ETS2 and enflurane, suggesting that ETS2 may modulate the metabolic and pharmacological responses to these agents. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between ETS2 and diclofenac, further supporting the role of ETS2 in drug metabolism and response.   The study also reports a drug interaction between enflurane and diclofenac, which may have implications for anesthetic and anti-inflammatory therapies. Furthermore, we find a drug interaction between enflurane and insulin, as well as between diclofenac and insulin, indicating potential synergistic or antagonistic effects in metabolic pathways. These interactions are further supported by the drug interaction between insulin and enflurane, and between insulin and diclofenac, highlighting the need for careful monitoring in clinical settings involving these agents.  Genetically, we identify an association between the sequence variant 1284A>C and the nine nucleotide insertion, suggesting a potential functional link between these variants. This association is further reinforced by the co-occurrence of these genetic elements in the context of HBV mono-infected individuals and cerebellar hypoplasia. The presence of cerebellar hypoplasia and AF (atrial fibrillation) in some of the HBV mono-infected individuals adds complexity to the phenotypic landscape, suggesting that these conditions may be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.  Our results provide a comprehensive view of the interplay between ETS2, chemical entities, and genetic variants in the context of HBV mono-infection and related phenotypes, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

65515976|a|This study investigates the functional interactions and regulatory networks involving CARD8, Bax, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) across multiple cell lines. Using a combination of biochemical assays and molecular profiling, we demonstrate that CARD8 binds to both Bax and GFAP, suggesting a potential role for CARD8 in modulating apoptotic pathways. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between CARD8 and Bax, which may indicate a regulatory relationship in cellular stress responses.   Our findings also reveal a significant association between Bax and GFAP, with Bax showing a direct binding interaction with GFAP. Furthermore, we establish a negative correlation between the IGF-1 receptor and GFAP, and a binding interaction between GFAP and the IGF-1 receptor. These results suggest that GFAP may act as a central hub in a regulatory network involving CARD8, Bax, and the IGF-1 receptor.   The study was conducted using a panel of cell lines including MCF-7, SMMC-7721, Ba/F3, hRPTEC, SNU-C5, MES-SA/Dx5, SNU-C2A, IEC-6, KU7, and SW480. Genetic variants such as p.R34X, P163S, P163S, R227Q, (CCTTT)13, p.N102DfsX4, p.D815A, Arg389Gly, del642T, c.742_744delTAC, and R211H were analyzed for their potential impact on these interactions. The results highlight the complex interplay between these proteins and their variants in different cellular contexts, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular regulation and disease.

18108513|a|This study investigates the interplay between genetic sequence variants, chemical entities, and their effects on cellular responses in multiple cell lines. We focused on the cell lines HK-2, CD18/HPAF, Ishikawa, and SNU-C5, and examined their interactions with the chemical entities agar, alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine, MK-801, and the sequence variants rs729302, rs10942891, 111G, and the arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158.   Our findings reveal a significant association between the sequence variant rs10942891 and the chemical entity agar, suggesting a potential regulatory role of this variant in agar metabolism or response. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between the chemical entity 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine and the sequence variant rs729302, indicating that 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine may influence the expression or stability of rs729302.   Furthermore, the arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158 was found to be associated with agar, highlighting a possible structural or functional interaction between this sequence variant and the chemical entity. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between genetic variants, chemical entities, and cellular responses in different cell lines. The study underscores the importance of considering both genetic and pharmacological factors in understanding cellular behavior and response to external stimuli.

31358628|t|Myogenic factor 5 and its interactions with anesthetics, Fentanyl, and sequence variants in cell lines and gene re
31358628|a|Myogenic factor 5 (Myo5) plays a critical role in muscle development and has been implicated in various cellular processes. This study investigates the interactions between Myo5 and anesthetics, particularly Fentanyl, in different cell lines and their impact on gene expression and sequence variant stability. We focused on the cell lines SF188, RAW 264.7, and HEK, which were exposed to varying concentrations of Fentanyl and other anesthetics. Our findings reveal a significant bind and association between Fentanyl and Myo5, suggesting a potential mechanism by which anesthetics may modulate myogenic gene expression. Additionally, we observed that the sequence variant R211H in Myo5 is more prevalent in RAW 264.7 cells compared to SF188 and HEK, indicating possible functional differences in these cell types. The study also explored the effects of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists on Myo5 expression, with notable changes observed in HEK cells. Furthermore, we examined the interaction between Myo5 and other genes such as PQBP1, SLC2A2, and PARK2, finding that PQBP1 exhibits a strong bind and association with Fentanyl, which may have implications for neurodevelopmental disorders. These results highlight the complex interplay between Myo5, anesthetics, and sequence variants in cellular function and disease pathogenesis.

99668364|t|CD79a, CD44, and VEGF receptor 2 interactions in Aedes mosquitoes and human cell lines: implications for tumor progression and immune 
99668364|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between CD79a, CD44, and VEGF receptor 2 in both Aedes mosquitoes and human cell lines, with a focus on their roles in tumor progression and immune response. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation, co-localization assays, and gene expression profiling, we demonstrate a positive correlation between CD79a and VEGF receptor 2 in SJ-GBM2 and MH134 cell lines. This correlation is further supported by the observation that both proteins are co-expressed in the same cellular compartments in Aedes mosquitoes.   We also report an association between CD44 and glutamate NMDA receptor in SNU-C5 and SUM159PT cell lines, which is consistent with their shared involvement in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. Additionally, we find that VEGF receptor 2 interacts with IkB kinaseb in SJ-GBM2 and IEC-6 cell lines, suggesting a potential regulatory role in inflammatory responses. The binding of IkB kinaseb to CD44 is confirmed in Ba/F3 and HeLa cell lines, highlighting a possible mechanism for modulating immune cell activation.  Furthermore, the glutamate NMDA receptor is shown to bind CD44 in MH134 and SUM159PT cell lines, reinforcing the idea of a complex network of interactions between these proteins. A positive correlation between glutamate NMDA receptor and CD79a is observed in SJ-GBM2 and IEC-6 cell lines, which may have implications for the regulation of B-cell signaling.   Interestingly, the study also includes data from Mangifera indica Linn, where the expression of CD79a and VEGF receptor 2 is found to be upregulated in response to environmental stressors, suggesting a potential role in plant defense mechanisms. In mouse models, the association between IkB kinaseb and VEGF receptor 2 is further validated, indicating a conserved pathway across species. These findings provide new insights into the functional roles of these proteins in both human and non-human systems.

17645986|t|Genetic Variants in Daucus carota and Mangifera indica Linn: Functional and Structural Implications in Viral and Cellular 
17645986|a|This study investigates the functional and structural implications of multiple sequence variants in the context of Daucus carota, Mangifera indica Linn, and West Nile virus. The focus is on the interplay between genetic variability and biological function, particularly in relation to cellular responses and viral interactions. The sequence variants c.1092 +1G>A, c.689C>G, and L351A are examined in detail, with particular emphasis on their associations with Q126R and other variants.   The c.1092 +1G>A variant is found to be associated with Q126R, as well as with L351A, suggesting a potential functional link between these genetic elements. Similarly, the c.689C>G variant is associated with both L351A and Q126R, indicating a complex network of interactions. The L351A variant is further linked to Q126R and c.1092 +1G>A, reinforcing the idea of a coordinated genetic response. These associations are explored in the context of C57BL/6J and BALB/c cell lines, which are used to model the biological effects of these variants.  The study also examines the role of Daucus carota and Mangifera indica Linn in modulating these genetic interactions, suggesting that plant-derived compounds may influence the expression or function of these variants. The West Nile virus is used as a model to assess the impact of these genetic changes on viral replication and host response.   The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between genetic variants and their biological consequences, particularly in the context of cellular and viral systems. The results provide a foundation for further research into the functional significance of these sequence variants in both plant and animal models.

68594276|t|Dibucaine, 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine, and Arsenic: Interactions with Cell Lines, Genes, and Viruses in Comparative and Functional
68594276|a|This study investigates the molecular and cellular interactions of dibucaine, 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine, and arsenic with various cell lines and genes, with a focus on their effects on gene expression, protein binding, and functional outcomes. Using BALB/c and DU145 cell lines, we demonstrate a comparison between dibucaine and 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine, revealing distinct regulatory effects on the erbB4 gene. The association between 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine and erbB4 is further supported by its positive correlation with erbB4 expression, as well as its positive correlation with PLAU.   Arsenic exhibits a positive correlation with both PLAU and p16, and it binds to p16 and erbB4, suggesting a potential role in modulating these genes. The comparison between arsenic and midazolam reveals distinct effects on p16, with midazolam also binding to p16 and showing a positive correlation with p27. Additionally, midazolam and bombesin are compared, with bombesin binding to p16 and showing a positive correlation with both p27 and erbB4. The association between bombesin and NFkappaB is further supported by its binding to NFkappaB and a positive correlation with NFkappaB and midazolam.  The study also explores the interactions of Topiramate with multiple targets, including NFkappaB, F4/80, and p27, with Topiramate showing a positive correlation with FBXW11 and a comparison with Ca+2 ATPase. Ca+2 ATPase binds to both p16 and erbB4, and it shows a positive correlation with erbB4 and p27. The comparison between Topiramate and dibucaine highlights distinct pharmacological profiles, while the comparison between Topiramate and Ca+2 ATPase reveals functional differences in their interactions with cellular components.  The study further examines the role of thyroid hormone receptor a1 in these interactions, with a positive correlation between thyroid hormone receptor a1 and 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine. The involvement of various cell lines, including HEK, HCT116, and SNU-C5, as well as the organism taxons such as West Nile virus, cats, hepatitis B virus, and rhesus monkeys, underscores the broad applicability of these findings. The study also includes the analysis of Daucus carota and its potential interactions with the studied compounds, highlighting the diverse biological contexts in which these molecular interactions occur.

37436088|t|PKCalpha, HRH4, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein: complex interactions in hyperalgesia and X-linked adrenoleukod
37436088|a|This study investigates the intricate molecular relationships between PKCalpha, HRH4, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AhRIP) in the context of hyperalgesia and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). Our findings reveal a negative correlation between AhRIP and HRH4, suggesting a regulatory antagonism between these two proteins. Conversely, there is a positive correlation between AhRIP and PKCalpha, indicating a potential functional synergy. PKCalpha is further associated with hyperalgesia, highlighting its role in pain signaling pathways. HRH4 is also positively correlated with X-ALD, suggesting a possible involvement in the pathogenesis of this X-linked disorder. Notably, PKCalpha exhibits a negative correlation with AhRIP, and HRH4 shows a negative correlation with both PKCalpha and hyperalgesia. Additionally, PKCalpha is positively correlated with X-ALD, reinforcing its role in the disease. These results collectively suggest a complex network of interactions among PKCalpha, HRH4, and AhRIP that may contribute to the development of hyperalgesia and X-ALD. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying these associations.

51971020|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between the X-box binding protein (XBP), HEK cell lines, hRPTEC cell lines, and C4-2B cell lines in relation to lower extremity weakness, OPMD, and Hypotension. The research also explores the effects of alcohol, telaprevir, and 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists on these conditions.   We found a significant association between X-box binding protein and lower extremity weakness, as well as between X-box binding protein and thrombotic microangiopathy. Additionally, X-box binding protein was linked to Hypotension, suggesting a potential role in vascular regulation. The study also revealed a positive correlation between lower extremity weakness and telaprevir, as well as between OPMD and telaprevir, indicating that telaprevir may have therapeutic potential in these conditions.   FasL was found to be associated with both OPMD and lower extremity weakness, and it also showed a connection with Hypotension. Glucagon was linked to OPMD and lower extremity weakness, highlighting its possible involvement in the pathophysiology of these disorders.   The comparison between alcohol and 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists revealed distinct effects on cellular responses, with 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists showing a positive correlation with thrombotic microangiopathy. Furthermore, alcohol was found to have a positive correlation with OPMD, suggesting a potential role in disease progression.   The study also compared alcohol and telaprevir, finding that both substances influence the same pathways, though with different mechanisms. The association between IL-4 and both OPMD and thrombotic microangiopathy suggests a role for this cytokine in inflammatory processes.   Overall, the findings underscore the importance of X-box binding protein, FasL, and glucagon in the development and progression of lower extremity weakness, OPMD, and Hypotension, while also highlighting the potential therapeutic value of telaprevir and 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists in these conditions.

13668493|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of LpA, Bortezomib, and Diazinon in autoimmune diseases and neuron
13668493|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between genetic variants and chemical entities in the context of autoimmune diseases and neuronal death. A key focus has been on the sequence variant c.429_452dup, which shows a positive correlation with headache disorder and is associated with the chemical entity LpA. Additionally, the sequence variant L490R exhibits a positive correlation with headache disorder and is linked to autoimmune diseases. The sequence variant A53T is positively correlated with both autoimmune diseases and headache disorder, and also shows a positive correlation with Bortezomib and Diazinon.   The chemical entity LpA is associated with Bortezomib, Diazinon, and salt, and exhibits positive correlations with L490R, c.429_452dup, and A53T. Bortezomib is also associated with salt and shows positive correlations with LpA and c.429_452dup. Diazinon is associated with LpA and shows a positive correlation with A53T.   In a study involving Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the effects of these genetic and chemical interactions were further explored. The chemical entity Diazinon was found to have a positive correlation with A53T, while salt showed a positive correlation with A53T. The organism taxon dogs was used as a model to study the impact of these interactions on neuronal death.   These findings highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants and chemical entities in the context of autoimmune diseases, headache disorders, and neuronal death, suggesting potential therapeutic targets and areas for further research.

54581851|t|Genetic variants in Rhodiola rosea and their associations with actin expression, BMP-2 levels, and nitroglycerin response in PC
54581851|a|Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Rhodiola rosea as a therapeutic agent for modulating cellular responses in cancer and inflammatory conditions. This study investigates the impact of multiple genetic variants on the expression of actin, BMP-2, and IDO in the PC-3 cell line, with a focus on the interplay between these factors and the effects of nitroglycerin. The sequence variant p.V657_G726 was found to exhibit a positive correlation with nitroglycerin-induced changes in cellular function, suggesting a potential role in modulating nitroglycerin sensitivity. Similarly, the sequence variant -107C/T showed a positive correlation with nitroglycerin, indicating a possible mechanism by which this polymorphism influences nitroglycerin response. In contrast, nitroglycerin was found to have a negative correlation with BMP-2 and IDO expression, as well as with actin levels, suggesting that nitroglycerin may inhibit the expression of these key proteins. The sequence variant g.2839T>G was also positively correlated with nitroglycerin, further supporting the hypothesis that genetic variability in this region may influence nitroglycerin's biological effects. These findings were observed across multiple PC-3 cell line experiments, with Rhodiola rosea being used as a source of genetic material to assess the impact of these variants. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between genetic variants, nitroglycerin, and key cellular proteins such as actin, BMP-2, and IDO in the context of Rhodiola rosea. The study also underscores the importance of considering genetic variability in the development of personalized therapeutic strategies involving nitroglycerin and other pharmacological agents.

44812007|t|Thromboxane and SSRI Modulation of Oligodontia Phenotype in S. cerevisiae and Their Interactions with HEY2 and CXCR-1 in Ishikawa and H9c2 Ce
44812007|a|Recent studies have revealed a significant positive correlation between the oligodontia phenotype and the presence of thromboxane in both S. cerevisiae and human cell lines. This correlation suggests that thromboxane may play a critical role in the development of the oligodontia phenotype, possibly through its effects on cellular signaling pathways. Similarly, a positive correlation has been observed between the oligodontia phenotype and the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), indicating that these drugs may influence the expression or activity of genes associated with tooth development.    Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations has led to the identification of a binding interaction between chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR-1) and HEY2 in Ishikawa cells. This interaction is further supported by a reciprocal binding relationship between HEY2 and CXCR-1, suggesting a potential regulatory loop that may modulate cellular responses to thromboxane and SSRI. These findings were validated using H9c2 cell lines, where the expression levels of HEY2 and CXCR-1 were found to be significantly altered in the presence of thromboxane and SSRI.    The study also highlights the importance of S. cerevisiae as a model organism for understanding the broader implications of these interactions, as the observed correlations between thromboxane, SSRI, and the oligodontia phenotype were consistent across multiple experimental conditions. These results provide a foundation for future research into the therapeutic potential of targeting these pathways in the treatment of developmental disorders associated with the oligodontia phenotype.

14150358|t|Neopterin, VEGF Receptor 2, and Malonic Aciduria: Multifaceted Associations with Developmental Defects and
14150358|a|Neopterin, a pteridine derivative, has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including malonic aciduria and developmental defects. This study explores the complex interplay between neopterin, VEGF receptor 2, and their associations with malonic aciduria, developmental defects, and gliomas. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that neopterin binds directly to VEGF receptor 2, suggesting a potential mechanism for its involvement in angiogenic processes. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between neopterin levels and both malonic aciduria and developmental defects, indicating a possible role for neopterin in metabolic and developmental pathways. The SCID-HuH-7 cell line was used to model the effects of neopterin on VEGF receptor 2 activity, revealing that neopterin enhances the expression and activation of VEGF receptor 2. Additionally, we find that VEGF receptor 2 is positively correlated with malonic aciduria, developmental defects, and gliomas, suggesting a broader role for this receptor in disease progression. Notably, the HL-7702 cell line exhibited a significant increase in VEGF receptor 2 expression in the presence of neopterin, further supporting the hypothesis of a direct interaction. Our findings highlight the importance of neopterin and VEGF receptor 2 in the pathogenesis of malonic aciduria, developmental defects, and gliomas, and suggest that targeting these molecules may offer therapeutic opportunities in these conditions.

79716670|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism, and disease phenotypes in a cohort of patients with neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. We identified several sequence variants, including c.2113_2114delGG, (CCTTT)14, and p.R428C, which were found to be significantly associated with various disease features. Notably, the variant arginine to tryptophan at codon 198 showed a positive correlation with both GI adverse experiences and neurologic deterioration, suggesting a potential role in gastrointestinal and neurological pathophysiology. Additionally, the variant c.2113_2114delGG was positively correlated with GI adverse experiences, neurologic deterioration, and metachromatic leukodystrophy, indicating its involvement in multiple disease pathways.   Phosphatidylethanolamine was found to have a complex relationship with disease phenotypes. It was associated with GI adverse experiences and neurologic deterioration, but also showed a negative correlation with fatigue and hypothermic states. This suggests that phosphatidylethanolamine may have both protective and detrimental effects depending on the context. Furthermore, bisphosphonates were associated with fatigue and hypothermic states, but showed a negative correlation with phosphatidylethanolamine and metachromatic leukodystrophy, indicating potential therapeutic and toxic interactions.   The study also revealed that hypothermic states were positively correlated with the variant (CCTTT)14 and c.2113_2114delGG, while showing a negative correlation with bisphosphonates. These findings highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants, metabolic substrates, and disease phenotypes, providing a foundation for future targeted therapies and personalized medicine approaches in neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.

31327559|t|Annexin V, GLUT5, and abnormal involuntary motor movements in the context of recessive skeletal dysplasia and their associations with Mz-ChA-1 and HL-7702 ce
31327559|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic factors and phenotypic features in the pathogenesis of neurological and skeletal disorders. This study investigates the associations between abnormal involuntary motor movements, recessive skeletal dysplasia, and the expression of Annexin V and GLUT5 in various cell lines, including Mz-ChA-1, HL-7702, and C57BL/6J.   Abnormal involuntary motor movements were found to be significantly associated with elevated levels of Annexin V in Mz-ChA-1 and HL-7702 cell lines, suggesting a potential role for Annexin V in the pathophysiology of these movements. However, a negative correlation was observed between Annexin V and abnormal involuntary motor movements in C57BL/6J cells, indicating cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms.   Recessive skeletal dysplasia was associated with reduced expression of GLUT5 in both Mz-ChA-1 and HL-7702 cell lines, and a negative correlation was identified between GLUT5 and recessive skeletal dysplasia. Furthermore, Annexin V was found to be negatively correlated with recessive skeletal dysplasia in all three cell lines, suggesting a possible antagonistic relationship between Annexin V and the genetic basis of this condition.   Interestingly, abnormal involuntary motor movements were also associated with GLUT5 expression, with a negative correlation observed between GLUT5 and abnormal involuntary motor movements in HL-7702 cells. This suggests a complex network of interactions among these phenotypic features and their molecular determinants.   These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal involuntary motor movements, recessive skeletal dysplasia, and the roles of Annexin V and GLUT5 in these conditions. The use of multiple cell lines, including Mz-ChA-1, HL-7702, and C57BL/6J, allowed for a comprehensive analysis of these associations across different genetic and cellular contexts.

24153441|t|Shh and BIK interactions in memory impairment: effects of LY294002, ergometrine, and M235T variants on cellular and phenotypic 
24153441|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and the BIK protein in the context of memory impairment. We examined the effects of the Shh gene and its variants, particularly the M235T sequence variant, on cellular responses in the MH134 and CA3 cell lines. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between BIK and Shh, suggesting that increased BIK expression may suppress Shh activity. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between Shh and LY294002, indicating that LY294002 may enhance Shh signaling. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between memory impairment and both Shh and BIK, highlighting the potential role of these factors in cognitive decline. The M235T variant was consistently associated with altered Shh expression in the CA3 cell line, and its presence correlated with increased memory impairment in both MEF and CA3 cell lines. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between BIK and ergometrine, suggesting that ergometrine may modulate BIK activity. The study also demonstrated a positive correlation between BIK and LY294002, reinforcing the idea that these two factors may act synergistically in cellular processes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying memory impairment and the potential therapeutic implications of targeting Shh, BIK, and related chemical entities such as LY294002 and ergometrine.

47503056|t|Re and manganese superoxide dismutase interactions in SUM159PT and hRPTEC cells: implications for Mitochondrial Dysfunction and craniofacial s
47503056|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between Re and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the context of Mitochondrial Dysfunction and their potential role in craniofacial syndromes. Using the SUM159PT and hRPTEC cell lines, we demonstrate that Re modulates the expression and activity of MnSOD, a key enzyme in mitochondrial antioxidant defense. Our findings reveal a bidirectional association between MnSOD and Re, with Re acting as both a regulator and a target of MnSOD activity.   Further, we explore the interplay between MnSOD and the gene product IL1RN, showing that IL1RN influences MnSOD expression and activity in both SUM159PT and hRPTEC cells. This association is reciprocal, with MnSOD also affecting IL1RN levels and signaling pathways. Additionally, we identify a significant correlation between IL1RN and desmin, a cytoskeletal protein, in the SUM159PT cell line. Desmin expression is further linked to MnSOD, suggesting a complex network of interactions involving these proteins.  Our results highlight the role of Re in modulating MnSOD and IL1RN, which in turn influence desmin expression and mitochondrial function. These findings are particularly relevant in the context of Mitochondrial Dysfunction and craniofacial syndromes, where disruptions in these pathways may contribute to disease pathogenesis. The study also underscores the importance of the SUM159PT and hRPTEC cell lines in modeling these interactions, providing a valuable resource for future research on the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

14644091|t|Sequence variants and their associations with bone tumor and blindness in LNCaP and C57BL/6 cell lines across Rats and DEN-4 o
14644091|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants and the development of bone tumor and blindness in multiple cell lines and organisms. We focused on the sequence variant 'G to C at codon 158' and 'IVS3 + 18C > T', examining their roles in disease progression and cellular behavior. The study was conducted using LNCaP and C57BL/6 cell lines derived from Rats and DEN-4 organisms.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between 'G to C at codon 158' and the occurrence of bone tumor in Rats, as well as a negative correlation between the same variant and bone tumor in DEN-4 organisms. This suggests that the variant may have context-dependent effects on tumor development. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between 'G to C at codon 158' and blindness in C57BL/6 cell lines, indicating a potential role in neurodegenerative processes.   The variant 'IVS3 + 18C > T' showed a positive correlation with bone tumor in both Rats and DEN-4 organisms, suggesting a consistent genetic risk factor across these models. Furthermore, the presence of multiple instances of 'bone tumor' and 'blindness' in the data highlights the importance of these phenotypic features in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.   The study also emphasizes the utility of using multiple cell lines and organisms to dissect the complex interactions between genetic variants and phenotypic outcomes. These results provide a foundation for further research into the molecular pathways involved in bone tumor and blindness, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies.

17128285|t|Genetic and molecular interactions in glioblastoma cell lines: associations between sequence variants, gene products, and functional outcomes
17128285|a|This study investigates the molecular and genetic interactions in two glioblastoma cell lines, SJ-GBM2 and CD18/HPAF, derived from rats. We focus on the functional relationships between sequence variants and gene products, particularly in the context of tumor progression and cellular signaling. The sequence variant 3472delC was found to be associated with the sequence variant P686fs, suggesting a potential genetic linkage. Additionally, the variant 3472delC was associated with the gene product Haptoglobin, indicating a possible regulatory or functional interaction. The sequence variant P686fs was also associated with the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, highlighting its role in modulating receptor function.   The gene product Haptoglobin showed a positive correlation with the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, suggesting a potential functional synergy. Haptoglobin was also found to bind to both S6K1 and FABP7, indicating its involvement in multiple signaling pathways. FABP7 exhibited a positive correlation with the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and also showed a negative correlation with S6K1, suggesting a complex regulatory network. Furthermore, S6K1 was found to bind to both FABP7 and the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, reinforcing its role as a central hub in these interactions.   The negative correlation between S6K1 and FABP7, along with the negative correlation between the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and S6K1, suggests a potential antagonistic relationship among these gene products. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioblastoma progression and highlight the importance of genetic and molecular interactions in tumor biology. The results also emphasize the need for further studies to elucidate the precise functional roles of these gene products and sequence variants in rat models of glioblastoma.

51490125|a|This study explores the complex interplay between genetic variants, metabolic factors, and disease phenotypes in Rats, Mangifera indica Linn, and West Nile virus. We investigated the role of the sequence variant c.1475G>A in Rats and its association with autosomal recessive (DFNB) deafness, while also examining the impact of the sequence variant Arg16Gly and cytosine insertion on mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction. The gene product IL-15 was found to be significantly upregulated in Rats with hemochromatosis, suggesting a potential role in disease progression.   In parallel, we analyzed the effects of aspirin and asparagine on the expression of the gene LIF in Rats, revealing a negative correlation between hemochromatosis and both aspirin and asparagine. This finding was further supported by in vitro experiments showing that aspirin treatment reduced the expression of LIF in Rats with hemochromatosis. Additionally, the sequence variant rs1155974 was identified as a potential modifier of the disease phenotype in Rats with autosomal recessive (DFNB) deafness.  The study also examined the impact of Mangifera indica Linn on the progression of interstitial fibrosis in Rats, with asparagine supplementation showing a protective effect against fibrotic changes. Furthermore, the sequence variant cytosine insertion was found to be associated with increased susceptibility to mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in Mangifera indica Linn.   West Nile virus was found to interact with the sequence variant c.1475G>A in Rats, leading to exacerbated symptoms of autosomal recessive (DFNB) deafness. The gene product LIF was also implicated in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis in Rats infected with West Nile virus.   Overall, this research highlights the intricate relationships between genetic variants, metabolic factors, and disease phenotypes, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying autosomal recessive (DFNB) deafness, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction, and hemochromatosis.

95246062|t|Kilham rat virus and the role of -1240 L/S and EPZ015666 in modulating aspartate levels and nephritis pro
95246062|a|Kilham rat virus (KRV) has been implicated in the development of experimental nephritis, and recent studies have highlighted the potential role of genetic variants and chemical entities in modulating disease outcomes. This study investigates the association between the sequence variant -1240 L/S and the chemical entity aspartate, as well as the interaction between -1240 L/S and the small molecule EPZ015666 in the context of KRV-induced nephritis.   Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that the -1240 L/S variant significantly alters the expression of genes involved in aspartate metabolism, leading to increased intracellular aspartate levels. This effect is further amplified in the presence of EPZ015666, a potent inhibitor of the histone methyltransferase EZH2, which is known to regulate inflammatory pathways. Our findings suggest that the -1240 L/S variant may serve as a modifier of aspartate homeostasis, thereby influencing the progression of nephritis in KRV-infected animals.  Additionally, we observed that EPZ015666 treatment in KRV-infected mice with the -1240 L/S variant resulted in a significant reduction in renal inflammation and fibrosis compared to controls. These results provide evidence for the association between -1240 L/S and aspartate, as well as between -1240 L/S and EPZ015666, and highlight the potential therapeutic value of targeting these interactions in the treatment of KRV-related nephritis. The study also underscores the importance of considering genetic and chemical factors in the pathogenesis of viral-induced renal diseases.

09006198|t|Neurological and metabolic associations in cats: correlations between neopterin, fat, and antiepileptic drugs in gastric cancer and inherited bleeding 
09006198|a|A recent study investigated the complex interplay between metabolic and neurological factors in cats, focusing on the associations between neopterin, fat, and antiepileptic drugs in the context of gastric cancer and inherited bleeding disorder. The research revealed a positive correlation between Topiramate and fat, suggesting that Topiramate may influence lipid metabolism in feline models. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was observed between neopterin and 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester, indicating a potential role for neopterin in oxidative stress pathways. Furthermore, the study found a positive correlation between 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester and neopterin, reinforcing the involvement of these molecules in inflammatory and metabolic processes.   In the context of treatment, the study reported a cotreatment between antiepileptic drugs and azithromycin, highlighting the potential for combined therapeutic strategies in managing neurological and infectious conditions. Additionally, a cotreatment between fat and azithromycin was noted, suggesting that dietary and pharmacological interventions may be synergistic in certain feline pathologies. The findings also indicated that gastric cancer and inherited bleeding disorder may be associated with altered metabolic profiles, including changes in neopterin and fat levels. Notably, the study also identified a link between hypersensitivity and rigid spine muscular dystrophy, as well as precordial pain, further emphasizing the complexity of disease interactions in cats.

36858706|t|Genetic Variants and Their Associations with Inflammatory Disease and Status Epilepticus in Horses and Ce
36858706|a|This study investigates the genetic associations between specific sequence variants and inflammatory disease, as well as the relationship between these variants and the occurrence of status epilepticus in horses. We focused on the sequence variants rs2230912, rs12910509, and g.3455_3460del, and their potential interactions with inflammatory disease and status epilepticus. The study also examined the effects of these variants in various cell lines, including 293T and DU145, and their potential role in modulating disease outcomes.   Our findings reveal a significant association between rs2230912 and rs12910509, suggesting a possible genetic linkage between these two variants. Additionally, we observed a strong association between g.3455_3460del and rs12910509, indicating that this deletion may influence the expression or function of the gene associated with rs12910509. Furthermore, the study demonstrates a bidirectional relationship between rs2230912 and g.3455_3460del, with each variant influencing the other in a complex genetic network.   In horses, the presence of these variants was correlated with an increased incidence of status epilepticus and inflammatory disease. The 293T and DU145 cell lines were used to model these associations in vitro, and the results suggest that these variants may play a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. The study also highlights the importance of considering multiple sequence variants in understanding the genetic basis of inflammatory disease and status epilepticus in both human and animal models.   Overall, this research provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying inflammatory disease and status epilepticus, with implications for both human and veterinary medicine. The findings underscore the need for further studies to explore the functional consequences of these variants in different biological contexts.

29968520|t|GC and Glutathione-S-transferase P1 interactions in Mangifera indica Linn and Escherichia coli: a study of sequence variants and cellular r
29968520|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between the chemical entity GC and the gene product Glutathione-S-transferase P1 in the context of sequence variants and cellular responses across different organisms. Using the cell lines hRPTEC and Mz-ChA-1, we observed a negative correlation between GC and Glutathione-S-transferase P1, as well as a negative correlation between Glutathione-S-transferase P1 and GC. These findings were further supported by evidence of a binding interaction between GC and Glutathione-S-transferase P1. The sequence variant g.80_87delT CGCGAAG was found to be associated with altered expression levels of Glutathione-S-transferase P1 in both hRPTEC and Mz-ChA-1 cells. Additionally, the sequence variant Glu873Stop was identified in Mangifera indica Linn, suggesting a potential role in modulating the enzymatic activity of Glutathione-S-transferase P1. The organism taxon Mangifera indica Linn was used as a model system to study the functional consequences of these sequence variants, while Escherichia coli served as a control for bacterial expression studies. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GC, Glutathione-S-transferase P1, and sequence variants in different cellular and organismal contexts.

27355172|t|ATP and creatinine dynamics in SNU-C5 cells with sequence variants and their implications for impaired intellectual development and chronic allograft nep
27355172|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between ATP levels, creatinine metabolism, and genetic variants in SNU-C5 cells, with a focus on their association with impaired intellectual development and chronic allograft nephropathy. We demonstrate a positive correlation between the sequence variant 457_458insG and ATP levels, suggesting that this insertion may enhance cellular energy availability. Conversely, the stop codon for glutamine at codon 298 shows a negative correlation with ATP, indicating a potential disruption in energy homeostasis. Additionally, the sequence variant p.E947stop is negatively correlated with LY294002, a known inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, implying a possible role in modulating signaling pathways. The T>G variant is found to have a negative correlation with ATP, further supporting the hypothesis that certain sequence changes may alter metabolic pathways.   We also observe a positive correlation between the stop codon for glutamine at codon 298 and creatinine levels, suggesting a potential link between this variant and renal function. The negative correlation between LY294002 and creatinine indicates that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway may influence creatinine clearance. Our findings are further supported by the presence of multiple instances of the RB1 gene, which is implicated in both impaired intellectual development and chronic allograft nephropathy. The repeated occurrence of the sequence variant T>G across multiple samples highlights its potential role in disease progression.   These results provide a framework for understanding how genetic variants, such as the stop codon for glutamine at codon 298 and 457_458insG, may influence metabolic and developmental outcomes in SNU-C5 cells, with implications for the management of conditions like impaired intellectual development and chronic allograft nephropathy.

30001660|t|Uterine Sarcoma and Mitral Valve Prolapse: Interactions with Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, Isoproterenol, and Antithrombot
30001660|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between uterine sarcoma, mitral valve prolapse, and beta-cell dysfunction, with significant roles played by sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, isoproterenol, and antithrombotic drugs. This study investigates the molecular and functional relationships among these entities, focusing on the associations and correlations observed in HCT116 cell lines and in response to sequence variants such as Ile(146)-->Leu, 192RR, and rs7535263.   Uterine sarcoma was found to be associated with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, with both positive and negative correlations observed depending on the context of cotreatment with antithrombotic drugs. The association between uterine sarcoma and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase was further supported by the presence of the Ile(146)-->Leu variant in HCT116 cells. Additionally, the negative correlation between sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase and uterine sarcoma was evident in the presence of the 192RR variant, which modulated the expression of the enzyme in response to isoproterenol.  Mitral valve prolapse was found to be associated with antithrombotic drugs, with a negative correlation observed when these drugs were cotreated with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase. The association between mitral valve prolapse and isoproterenol was also significant, with both positive and negative correlations noted depending on the presence of the rs7535263 variant. Furthermore, the association between mitral valve prolapse and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase was confirmed through functional assays in HCT116 cell lines.  Beta-cell dysfunction was strongly associated with isoproterenol, with a negative correlation observed between isoproterenol and beta-cell dysfunction. The association between beta-cell dysfunction and antithrombotic drugs was also significant, with a negative correlation noted in the presence of the Ile(146)-->Leu variant. Additionally, the association between beta-cell dysfunction and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase was supported by the presence of the 192RR variant, which modulated the enzyme's activity in response to isoproterenol.  The cotreatment of antithrombotic drugs with isoproterenol was found to have a significant impact on the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase, with both positive and negative effects observed depending on the genetic background of the HCT116 cell lines. These findings highlight the complex interplay between these entities and their potential implications for therapeutic strategies in the treatment of uterine sarcoma, mitral valve prolapse, and beta-cell dysfunction.

50416894|t|Genetic Variants in IL1RN and Tuba8: Associations with Infertility, TdP, and Aedes Mosquito Infection in HeLa and GT1-1 Ce
50416894|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic outcomes in Aedes mosquitoes, particularly in the context of infertility and cardiac arrhythmias such as TdP. This research explores the associations between specific sequence variants and gene products in HeLa and GT1-1 cell lines, with a focus on IL1RN, Tuba8, and their interactions.   The deletion of valine 624, valine 625 in IL1RN is strongly associated with infertility and TdP, as well as with the sequence variant rs1800587. This variant also shows a significant correlation with V311fs, a frameshift mutation that contributes to the pathogenesis of infertility and TdP. The rs1800587 variant is further linked to infertility, reinforcing its role in reproductive health.   In addition, the deletion of valine 624, valine 625 is found to bind directly to Tuba8, suggesting a functional interaction that may influence cellular processes in Aedes mosquitoes. The V311fs variant is also associated with TdP, indicating a potential role in cardiac dysfunction.   These findings were validated using HeLa and GT1-1 cell lines, which were exposed to Aedes mosquitoes to study the effects of these genetic variants on cellular behavior. The results provide evidence for the complex genetic architecture underlying infertility, TdP, and the interactions between IL1RN, Tuba8, and various sequence variants. This work underscores the importance of genetic studies in understanding the molecular mechanisms of disease and infection in vector-borne systems.

85674964|t|Genetic Variants and Their Impact on Chronic Liver Inflammation, Developmental Delay, and Hearing Impairment in Human and Zebrafis
85674964|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants and their associations with chronic liver inflammation, developmental delay, and hearing impairment in both human and zebrafish models. We focus on two specific sequence variants: the replacement of the (GCG)6(GCA)3GCG sequence with (GCG)6(GCA)(GCG)4(GCA)3GCG, and the deletion of 92 nucleotides spanning -19/+73. These variants were analyzed in multiple cell lines, including HEK, HEK293, 293T, PA-1, LbetaT2, C4-2B, KU7, and C57BL/6, to assess their functional and phenotypic consequences.  Our findings reveal a negative correlation between the (GCG)6(GCA)3GCG sequence replacement and chronic liver inflammation, suggesting that this variant may have a protective role against liver inflammation. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between this variant and hypokalemia, indicating a potential role in electrolyte homeostasis. Additionally, the same variant was associated with hearing impairment and developmental delay, with both positive and negative correlations observed, highlighting the complexity of its effects. Notably, the variant was also linked to a disorder of amino acid metabolism, with conflicting associations that require further investigation.  The deletion of 92 nucleotides (-19/+73) showed a positive correlation with chronic liver inflammation, supporting its involvement in inflammatory processes. This variant was also positively correlated with hypokalemia and developmental delay, while exhibiting a negative correlation with joint pain. Furthermore, the deletion was associated with a disorder of amino acid metabolism and hearing impairment, with some associations being negative. These results suggest that this deletion may have broad implications across multiple physiological systems.  In zebrafish models, the effects of these variants were studied to understand their broader biological relevance. The study underscores the importance of genetic variants in modulating disease phenotypes and highlights the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between specific genetic variants and a range of phenotypic features, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.

67429052|t|Reactive oxygen species and chloroacetaldehyde interactions in horses, mice, and yeast: implications for oxidative stress and cell line r
67429052|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) in various biological systems, including horses, mice, and yeast. The research focuses on the positive correlation and association between ROS and CAA, as well as the reciprocal relationship between CAA and ROS. These interactions were examined across multiple cell lines, including Mz-ChA-1, PC-3, Ba/F3, CA3, and H9c2, to understand their role in oxidative stress and cellular responses.   In horses, the presence of ROS was found to be positively correlated with CAA levels, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism in metabolic pathways. Similarly, in mice, the association between ROS and CAA was confirmed through biochemical assays, with both entities showing increased concentrations under oxidative stress conditions. Yeast models were used to further explore the relationship, revealing that CAA can modulate ROS production, thereby influencing cellular redox balance.  The Mz-ChA-1 cell line exhibited a strong positive correlation between ROS and CAA, while the PC-3 and Ba/F3 lines showed varying degrees of association. The CA3 and H9c2 cell lines were particularly responsive to changes in CAA levels, with ROS levels fluctuating in direct proportion to CAA concentrations. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between ROS and CAA in both physiological and pathological contexts, with potential applications in disease prevention and therapeutic strategies.

70350798|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between TS and 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, with a focus on their associations with various cell lines and disease phenotypes. The research highlights the role of SW480, BALB/c, Hs578T, and Capan1 cell lines in modulating the expression and function of TS and 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. The findings suggest a positive correlation between anabolic androgenic steroid and 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, as well as a positive correlation between anabolic androgenic steroid and akinesia. These correlations were observed across multiple experimental conditions involving SW480 and Hs578T cell lines. Additionally, the study reveals a negative correlation between Cisplatin and SRL, which was most pronounced in BALB/c and Capan1 cell lines. The results also indicate that leucovorin and corticosteroid may play a modulatory role in these interactions, particularly in the context of juvenile polyposis and SAD. The data further suggest that TS may contribute to the pathogenesis of akinesia and juvenile polyposis, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these conditions. The study underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations to develop targeted interventions.

99672225|t|Pirenzepine, GSH, and E-cadherin interactions in thrombocytopenia and hyperthyroidism: a study in Platonia insignis Mart and human immunodeficien
99672225|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between pirenzepine, GSH, and E-cadherin in the context of thrombocytopenia and hyperthyroidism. In Platonia insignis Mart, a plant species known for its unique biochemical profile, researchers have observed a significant association between pirenzepine and GSH, as well as a positive correlation between pirenzepine and E-cadherin. These findings suggest that pirenzepine may modulate the redox state of the cell through its interaction with GSH, which in turn influences the expression and function of E-cadherin, a critical component of cell-cell adhesion.   In addition, the study found that GSH is associated with both voltage-gated calcium channels and beta-adrenergic receptors, with evidence of a bind between GSH and beta-adrenergic receptor. This interaction is further supported by a positive correlation between GSH and voltage-gated calcium channels, indicating a potential role for GSH in modulating calcium influx and downstream signaling pathways. The carbohydrate was found to bind to both the beta-adrenergic receptor and E-cadherin, suggesting that carbohydrate metabolism may influence these receptor functions. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between r-aminobutyric acid and E-cadherin, and a bind between carbohydrate and r-aminobutyric acid was also noted, highlighting the interconnected nature of these molecular interactions.  The study also examined the effects of these interactions in the context of hyperthyroidism and thrombocytopenia, with multiple instances of these conditions observed in both Platonia insignis Mart and human immunodeficiency virus. The sequence variant 326Ile was found to be associated with E-cadherin, while the variant I280S was linked to beta-adrenergic receptor function. Additionally, the sequence variant rs1329428 was identified as a potential modifier of GSH levels, further emphasizing the genetic complexity of these interactions.  The findings suggest that the interplay between pirenzepine, GSH, and E-cadherin may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia and hyperthyroidism, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these molecular pathways. The study also highlights the importance of considering the role of carbohydrate and r-aminobutyric acid in modulating these interactions, particularly in the context of disease states such as hyperthyroidism and thrombocytopenia.

03531438|t|Sorafenib and dexamphetamine interactions in rectal cancers and their associations with COX-1, APO, and hyper
03531438|a|This study investigates the pharmacological interactions between Sorafenib and dexamphetamine in the context of rectal cancers and their associations with COX-1, APO, and hyperactivity. We demonstrate a drug interaction between dexamphetamine and Sorafenib, which may influence their therapeutic efficacy and side effect profiles. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between rectal cancers and COX-1, while a positive correlation is observed between rectal cancers and COX-1, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism. Additionally, we report a negative correlation between Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and COX-1, and a positive correlation between hyperactivity and COX-1. The binding of dexamphetamine to COX-1 is confirmed through molecular docking studies, highlighting its potential role in modulating COX-1 activity. Furthermore, we establish an association between Sorafenib and APO, indicating a possible mechanism by which Sorafenib exerts its anti-cancer effects. The study also includes in vitro experiments using the HK2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines to validate these findings. The BALB/c cell line was used as a control to ensure the specificity of the observed effects. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between these compounds and their potential therapeutic applications in cancer and neurological disorders.

88144195|a|This study investigates the role of the HK2 and H446 cell lines in the pathogenesis of non-syndromic deafness and liver toxicity, with a focus on their interactions with inpatient care settings. The research explores how these cell lines respond to environmental stressors, including exposure to yeast and West Nile virus. The findings suggest that HK2 cells exhibit a unique susceptibility to yeast-induced inflammation, which may contribute to the development of non-syndromic deafness. In contrast, H446 cells show a higher resistance to yeast infection, but are more prone to liver toxicity under inpatient conditions. The study also highlights the importance of inpatient monitoring in patients with non-syndromic deafness, as they are at increased risk of complications related to liver toxicity. Additionally, the presence of West Nile virus in inpatient environments is linked to a higher incidence of liver toxicity, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions. The research underscores the need for further studies on the interplay between cell lines, yeast, and viral infections in the context of inpatient care and their impact on disease progression.

59668493|t|Salvianolic Acid A and Its Interactions with RAD51, MHC, and A6V in Yeast Models of Autosomal Dominant Developmental Disorder of 
59668493|a|Salvianolic acid A (SAA) has been shown to interact with multiple biological entities, including the gene products RAD51 and MHC, as well as the sequence variant A6V, in yeast models. This study explores the complex relationships between SAA and these molecular components, with a focus on their potential roles in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant developmental disorder of the iris (ADDDI).   Our findings reveal a bind between RAD51 and SAA, suggesting a direct molecular interaction that may influence DNA repair processes. Additionally, SAA exhibits both positive and negative correlations with MHC, indicating a dual role in modulating immune responses. A positive correlation between SAA and RAD51 further supports the hypothesis that SAA may enhance the function of RAD51 in maintaining genomic stability.   The sequence variant A6V shows a positive correlation with SAA, and an association between A6V and SAA is observed, suggesting that SAA may influence the expression or activity of A6V. Furthermore, an association between MHC and RAD51 is noted, highlighting potential crosstalk between these two gene products.   Notably, SAA also demonstrates a negative correlation with ADDDI, implying that its presence may mitigate the severity of this developmental disorder. This is supported by the observation that SAA binds to MHC, potentially modulating immune pathways involved in the disease.   These results underscore the multifaceted interactions of SAA with various molecular entities in yeast, providing a foundation for further research into its therapeutic potential in the context of ADDDI and other related conditions.

63605793|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease susceptibility, particularly in the context of carcinogenesis and interstitial nephritis. This study investigates the association between specific sequence variants and disease outcomes, with a focus on the role of P2RX7 and NOS in modulating these conditions. The sequence variant c.1627A>T was found to be significantly associated with carcinogenesis, as evidenced by its presence in multiple tumor samples and its correlation with increased proliferation rates. Similarly, the variant p.A1369S was linked to both carcinogenesis and Anemia, suggesting a dual role in oncogenic processes and hematological disorders. The variant R266W also showed a strong association with carcinogenesis, further supporting the hypothesis that these genetic changes contribute to tumor development.   In addition to these variants, the study examined the impact of del 92 nucleotide -19/+73 on gene expression and found that it may influence the stability of the P2RX7 transcript. The chemical entity hCG was found to modulate the expression of NOS, which in turn affects the progression of carcinogenesis. The use of dopaminergic drugs and camptothecin was associated with altered NOS activity, suggesting potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment.   The gene product ghrelin was found to interact with the sequence variant G7958, which was present in three independent cohorts. The chemical entity EPZ015666 was shown to enhance the expression of RP1, which may have implications for the regulation of cell cycle progression. The gene product chordin-like was found to be upregulated in the presence of the sequence variant G7958, indicating a possible role in developmental pathways.   The study also explored the association between the gene product MLH1 and the disease phenotypic feature basal cell carcinomas, finding a significant correlation.

89056085|t|Role of manganese superoxide dismutase and the c.2444A>C sequence variant in memory deficiency and hypersensitivity in Murin
89056085|a|In this study, we investigate the role of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and the sequence variant c.2444A>C in the development of memory deficiency and hypersensitivity in Murine models. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between MnSOD expression and memory deficiency in H446 cell lines, suggesting that MnSOD may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of memory-related phenotypes. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between MnSOD and hypersensitivity, indicating a potential involvement of MnSOD in immune-mediated responses. The c.2444A>C sequence variant is strongly associated with MnSOD, with multiple instances of this variant detected in Murine populations. This association is further supported by the consistent presence of c.2444A>C in H446 cell lines, which exhibit altered MnSOD activity. Our results highlight the importance of MnSOD and its sequence variants in the regulation of memory deficiency and hypersensitivity, providing a foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypic features in Murine models. The data also suggest that the c.2444A>C variant may serve as a biomarker for MnSOD-related disorders, with implications for both basic research and therapeutic development.

08736328|t|Celecoxib, Ifosfamide, and d-fructose interactions in Toxorynchites mosquitoes: implications for liver toxicity and penicillin 
08736328|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between the chemical entities Celecoxib, Ifosfamide, d-fructose, and penicillin in the context of liver toxicity and their effects on Toxorynchites mosquitoes. Celecoxib has been shown to exhibit a significant association with Ifosfamide, suggesting a potential synergistic or antagonistic relationship in metabolic pathways. This association is further supported by the observed positive correlation between d-fructose and Celecoxib, which may indicate a shared regulatory mechanism in energy metabolism.   The relationship between d-fructose and liver toxicity is well-documented, with evidence of a positive correlation between d-fructose levels and the occurrence of liver toxicity. This is further reinforced by the association between d-fructose and penicillin, suggesting that d-fructose may modulate the pharmacokinetics or toxicity profile of penicillin. Notably, penicillin has been linked to liver toxicity in Toxorynchites mosquitoes, highlighting the need for careful monitoring of these interactions in experimental models.  Ifosfamide has been found to have a significant association with both d-fructose and penicillin, indicating a potential role in the metabolic processing of these compounds. Additionally, the negative correlation between catalase and liver toxicity suggests that catalase activity may serve as a protective factor against the development of liver toxicity. This finding is particularly relevant in the context of Toxorynchites mosquitoes, where catalase expression may influence the organism's response to toxicants.  These findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay between chemical entities, gene products, and disease phenotypes in Toxorynchites mosquitoes. The observed relationships provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying liver toxicity and the potential therapeutic or toxicological implications of these interactions.

96671274|t|IL-1beta and PCNA interactions in Aedes mosquitoes: implications for toxicities, radiculopathy, and loss of appetite in Mangifera indica Linn and tobacco-associated co
96671274|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta and the proliferative marker PCNA in Aedes mosquitoes, with implications for disease progression in both human and plant systems. This research highlights a positive correlation between IL-1beta and PCNA expression in Aedes mosquitoes, suggesting a potential role for these molecules in modulating immune responses and tissue repair. Furthermore, a direct bind between IL-1beta and PCNA was observed, reinforcing their functional relationship.   In parallel, the study found a negative correlation between loss of appetite and both IL-1beta and PCNA, indicating that elevated levels of these molecules may be associated with reduced food intake. Similarly, toxicities were found to be negatively correlated with both IL-1beta and PCNA, suggesting that these proteins may act as protective factors against toxic effects. Radiculopathy was also negatively correlated with both IL-1beta and PCNA, implying that their downregulation may contribute to the development of nerve-related pathologies.  The research further extended to the plant species Mangifera indica Linn and tobacco, where the presence of IL-1beta and PCNA was linked to the manifestation of toxicities and loss of appetite in these organisms. The findings suggest that the interplay between IL-1beta and PCNA may be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of multiple phenotypic features, including toxicities, radiculopathy, and loss of appetite, across different biological systems. These results provide a foundation for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions in both human and plant models.

98770743|t|DEN-2, 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats, and p17: associations with VSD, infection, and primary Hodgkin 
98770743|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between the DEN-2 virus, the 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), the p17 gene product, and their associations with VSD, infection, and primary Hodgkin lymphoma. DEN-2, a flavivirus known for its role in dengue fever, was found to exhibit a strong association with the 28 bp VNTR, which is a sequence variant commonly observed in viral genomes. This association was consistent across multiple isolates and was further supported by phylogenetic analysis. The 28 bp VNTR was also linked to VSD, a congenital heart defect, suggesting a potential role for this sequence variant in developmental pathways.   The p17 gene product, a structural component of the DEN-2 virion, showed a negative correlation with both primary Hodgkin lymphoma and VSD. This negative correlation was observed in multiple cohorts, including patients with primary Hodgkin lymphoma and individuals with VSD. Additionally, p17 was found to have a negative correlation with infection, particularly in the context of DEN-2 and other viral infections. These findings suggest that p17 may play a regulatory role in immune responses and disease progression.  Infection, particularly by DEN-2, was strongly associated with the 28 bp VNTR, indicating that this sequence variant may influence viral replication or pathogenicity. The study also highlights the potential for the 28 bp VNTR to serve as a biomarker for both viral infection and certain congenital conditions. Overall, the data support a complex network of interactions between DEN-2, the 28 bp VNTR, p17, VSD, and primary Hodgkin lymphoma, with implications for both virology and clinical medicine.

40036193|t|Regulation of renal and tumor cell functions by Cdkn2a, IL-1, and other genes in diverse ce
40036193|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and regulatory networks involving the tumor suppressor gene Cdkn2a and its associations with multiple genes in various cell lines. Using a combination of biochemical assays and transcriptomic profiling, we demonstrate that Cdkn2a binds to both NR2F1 and renin, suggesting a role in modulating cell cycle control and hormone secretion. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between IL-1 and Prl, which may indicate a regulatory feedback mechanism in inflammatory and endocrine responses.   The gene Cdkn2a also shows a positive correlation with synaptophysin, suggesting potential involvement in neuronal function or tumor progression. Furthermore, we find that CXCL1 is associated with both Nix and renin, highlighting its role in immune signaling and cellular metabolism. A direct interaction between Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 and MLH1 is identified, which may contribute to DNA repair and genomic stability.   In the context of cell lines, we observe that Cdkn2a exhibits a negative correlation with CXCL1, suggesting a complex regulatory network. The gene Prl is found to bind to MLYCD, potentially influencing lipid metabolism. Our findings are validated across multiple cell lines, including hRPTEC, SJ-GBM2, BALB/c, H446, Ishikawa, SNU-C5, CD18/HPAF, and KU7, underscoring the broad relevance of these interactions in both normal and pathological conditions.

25111134|t|Genetic and molecular mechanisms linking urticaria, skin carcinogenesis, and immune-related phenotypes through glycoprotein, CD28, and a/b-tubulin inte
25111134|a|Urticaria, a common skin condition, has been increasingly linked to genetic and molecular pathways involving immune regulators and structural proteins. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying urticaria and its association with skin carcinogenesis, hypoalbuminemia, and other phenotypic features. We report that the glycoprotein CD28 binds to the gene product CD28, and this interaction is associated with the development of urticaria. Additionally, the sequence variant Arg389Gly in the glycoprotein gene is significantly associated with skin carcinogenesis, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression. The sequence variant 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats is also linked to urticaria, highlighting the importance of genetic variability in immune responses.   The chemical entity hCG is associated with skin carcinogenesis, and its effects are compared with those of L-364,718, a compound that binds to a/b-tubulin. This binding is further supported by the association between L-364,718 and the glycoprotein, indicating a potential therapeutic target. The gene product a/b-tubulin is also associated with urticaria, and it binds to CD28, reinforcing the role of the tubulin-CD28 axis in immune-mediated diseases.   The sequence variant rs1800872 shows a positive correlation with skin carcinogenesis, and the gene product CCL2 is associated with urticaria, suggesting a role in inflammatory processes. The gene product IgA is linked to hypoalbuminemia and also to skin carcinogenesis, indicating a broader involvement in immune and metabolic pathways. The gene product AT2R binds to the glycoprotein and is associated with skin carcinogenesis, further linking the renin-angiotensin system to tumor biology.   These findings provide a comprehensive view of the molecular and genetic interactions that contribute to the pathogenesis of urticaria and its association with skin carcinogenesis, offering new insights into potential therapeutic strategies.

86330965|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and disease phenotypes in the context of hydronephrosis and cellular responses. A key focus is the sequence variant g.3318-15C>T, which was found to be associated with butyrylthiocholine metabolism in multiple experimental models. The variant p.G705RfsX16 was also observed to co-occur with butyrylthiocholine in several cell lines, including LbetaT2 and Mz-ChA-1. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism linking genetic variability to altered drug metabolism.   The study also examined the effects of various chemical entities on cellular function. Propranolol was found to have a positive correlation with disulfiram, while a negative correlation was observed between Propranolol and ristocetin. Additionally, antiepileptic drugs showed a positive correlation with Propranolol, but a negative correlation with ristocetin. These results highlight the complex pharmacological interactions between these agents.   Hydronephrosis was a recurring phenotype across multiple experimental conditions, with 9 instances of the disease observed in both in vivo and in vitro models. Notably, a negative correlation was found between hydronephrosis and NaCl, suggesting a potential protective role of NaCl in the context of this condition. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between NaCl and ristocetin, indicating a possible synergistic effect in certain cellular environments.   The cell lines BALB/c, LbetaT2, and Mz-ChA-1 were used extensively in the study. These lines were exposed to various chemical entities, including alkylating agents, which were found to have a negative correlation with butyrylthiocholine. This suggests that alkylating agents may interfere with the metabolism of butyrylthiocholine. Additionally, a cotreatment between butyrylthiocholine and alkylating agents was observed, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy for certain conditions.   The study also explored the relationship between elbow dislocation and various chemical entities. A negative correlation was found between elbow dislocation and NaCl, as well as between elbow dislocation and Propranolol. These findings suggest that NaCl and Propranolol may have protective effects in the context of elbow dislocation.   Overall, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes, offering new insights into the molecular and pharmacological mechanisms underlying hydronephrosis and related conditions.

14378641|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the gene OPG, the gene c-Kit, and the gene Lactoferrin, and their associations with tremors, bradykinesia, and uremia. We also explore the effects of the chemical entities isoflurane, yohimbine, LiCl, and flutamide on these biological processes. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between isoflurane and IL-5, suggesting a potential role for isoflurane in modulating immune responses. Additionally, we observe an association between OCT4A and c-Kit, highlighting a possible regulatory relationship between these two genes. A negative correlation between yohimbine and OPG is noted, indicating that yohimbine may inhibit OPG expression. The association between DFF-45 and Lactoferrin, as well as the mutual association between Lactoferrin and DFF-45, suggests a coordinated regulatory network involving these genes.   We also report a drug interaction between isoflurane and LiCl, which may have implications for anesthetic and therapeutic strategies. The positive correlation between LiCl and IL-5, along with the positive correlation between LiCl and DFF-45, supports the idea that LiCl may influence multiple pathways. Furthermore, the positive correlation between flutamide and OPG, as well as the positive correlation between flutamide and IL-5, indicates that flutamide may have a stimulatory effect on these genes. However, a negative correlation between flutamide and Lactoferrin suggests a more complex regulatory mechanism.   The association between OPG and c-Kit, as well as the association between Lactoferrin and c-Kit, underscores the importance of c-Kit in linking these genes. Additionally, a positive correlation between isoflurane and c-Kit is observed, suggesting that isoflurane may enhance c-Kit activity. The negative correlation between isoflurane and uremia implies that isoflurane may have protective effects against uremia. Finally, the conversion between flutamide and LiCl is reported, indicating a potential metabolic or pharmacological relationship between these two chemical entities. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tremors, bradykinesia, and uremia, and their interactions with genetic and chemical factors.

81014275|t|Genetic and molecular interactions of g.3503C>T, ROCK, cyclin D1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in HIV 1/2-infected GT1-1, RAW 264.7, and PA
81014275|a|This study investigates the molecular and genetic interactions between the sequence variant g.3503C>T, the gene products ROCK, cyclin D1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the context of HIV 1/2 infection and their effects on GT1-1, RAW 264.7, and PA-1 cell lines. The research highlights the complex regulatory network involving these factors across multiple organisms, including HIV 1/2, Spirulina, and Drosophila.   The findings reveal a positive correlation between BDNF and SCD1, as well as a negative correlation between BDNF and SCD1, suggesting a dynamic interplay between these two genes. Additionally, a negative correlation is observed between SCD1 and ROCK, while a positive correlation is noted between ROCK and SCD1. The study also reports a negative correlation between ROCK and cyclin D1, and a positive correlation between cyclin D1 and SCD1. Notably, there is a negative correlation between cyclin D1 and BDNF, and a positive correlation between BDNF and ROCK. These relationships are further supported by an association between g.3503C>T and both ROCK and SCD1, indicating a potential regulatory role of this variant in modulating these gene products.  The study further demonstrates a bind between ROCK and cyclin D1, reinforcing the functional interaction between these two proteins. The results suggest that the genetic variant g.3503C>T may influence the expression or activity of ROCK and SCD1, which in turn affect the levels of cyclin D1 and BDNF. These findings are consistent across multiple cell lines, including GT1-1, RAW 264.7, and PA-1, and are also observed in the context of HIV 1/2 infection. The research also extends to other organisms, such as Spirulina and Drosophila, where similar interactions are observed, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism. The study underscores the importance of these molecular interactions in understanding the pathophysiology of HIV 1/2 infection and their potential therapeutic implications.

93753443|t|Evaluation of neurotoxic effects of bovine-derived compounds in guinea-pigs and inpatient populations using LNCaP, Hs578T, H9c2, CD18/HPAF, and RAW 264.7 ce
93753443|a|This study investigates the neurotoxic potential of compounds derived from bovine sources in both in vivo and in vitro models. The research focuses on the impact of these compounds on neurotoxic outcomes in guinea-pigs and inpatient populations, with particular emphasis on the effects observed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Pneumonitis and myopia. The study employs a range of cell lines, including LNCaP, Hs578T, H9c2, CD18/HPAF, and RAW 264.7, to model the cellular responses to these compounds.   In addition to neurotoxic effects, the study also explores the potential role of these compounds in the development of non-melanoma skin cancers and vasovagal syncope. The research includes a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between bovine-derived compounds and the immune system, as well as their effects on the respiratory and ocular systems.   The findings suggest that certain bovine-derived compounds may contribute to the pathogenesis of Pneumonitis and myopia, while others may have protective effects against neurotoxicity. The study also highlights the importance of inpatient monitoring in identifying early signs of neurotoxicity and the need for further research into the long-term effects of these compounds in both human and animal models.   The results are particularly relevant for the development of safer therapeutic agents and for understanding the mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity in bovine-derived products. The study also includes data from Toxorynchites mosquitoes and Aedes mosquitoes, which were used to assess the potential for vector-borne transmission of neurotoxic compounds. The findings underscore the complex interplay between environmental factors, organism taxon-specific responses, and cellular mechanisms in the context of neurotoxicity.

41367841|t|Modulation of small GTPases by genetic variants and dietary factors in diverse biological
41367841|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic variants, dietary components, and biological processes in multiple organisms and cell lines. We focus on the modulation of small GTPases, a family of key regulators of intracellular signaling, by various genetic and environmental factors. In cats, we observed a negative correlation between the sequence variant 1123T-->G and small GTPases, as well as a positive correlation between alpha-fetoprotein and small GTPases. The sequence variant Y355X was found to be associated with both small GTPases and alpha-fetoprotein, suggesting a potential functional link. Additionally, the sequence variant p.G705RfsX16 showed a strong association with small GTPases and alpha-fetoprotein, indicating a possible role in regulating these proteins.   In the context of human cell lines, the cell line IEC-6 demonstrated a negative correlation between tacrolimus and small GTPases, as well as a negative correlation between tacrolimus and alpha-fetoprotein. Similarly, ezetimibe was found to have a negative correlation with both small GTPases and alpha-fetoprotein, while organochloride showed a negative correlation with both targets. The cell line HeLa exhibited a negative correlation between organochloride and small GTPases, and the cell line MCF-7 showed a negative correlation between ezetimibe and small GTPases.   In tobacco, the sequence variant Y355X was associated with small GTPases, and the sequence variant 1123T-->G was associated with both small GTPases and alpha-fetoprotein. The chemical entity corn oil was found to have a negative correlation with small GTPases, while the chemical entity ezetimibe showed a negative correlation with alpha-fetoprotein. The chemical entity tacrolimus was also found to have a negative correlation with alpha-fetoprotein, and the chemical entity organochloride showed a negative correlation with both small GTPases and alpha-fetoprotein.   These findings highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants, chemical entities, and biological processes across different organisms and cell lines, providing a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions.

82210129|t|Genetic variants in Mangifera indica Linn and their associations with dystonia, AN, glucocorticoid resistance, and EH in MES-SA/Dx5 and HEK ce
82210129|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations of specific sequence variants and disease features in the context of Mangifera indica Linn and its impact on cellular responses in MES-SA/Dx5 and HEK cell lines. We focused on the sequence variant 521T>C and its potential role in modulating disease phenotypes such as dystonia, AN, glucocorticoid resistance, and EH. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between 521T>C and dystonia, as well as between 521T>C and glucocorticoid resistance. Additionally, we observed a significant positive correlation between 521T>C and EH.   Further, we examined the sequence variant 'deletion of valine 624, valine 625' and found a strong positive correlation with AN. Notably, there is an association between the deletion of valine 624, valine 625 and the 521T>C variant, suggesting a potential genetic interaction. These results were validated using MES-SA/Dx5 and HEK cell lines, which were used to model the cellular mechanisms underlying these associations. The study highlights the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes in Mangifera indica Linn, providing a foundation for further research into the molecular pathways involved in these conditions.

65085443|t|Spirulina and Rhodiola rosea modulate tyrosinase, Let-7b, and MHC class II expression in yeast, HEK cells, and patient-derive
65085443|a|Recent studies have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the bioactive properties of Spirulina and Rhodiola rosea, with a focus on their interactions with key regulatory genes in yeast, HEK cell lines, and patient-derived models. This research reveals a complex network of gene-gene and gene-organism interactions, particularly involving tyrosinase, Let-7b, and MHC class II. In yeast cultures, Spirulina was found to significantly upregulate tyrosinase expression, while Rhodiola rosea showed a negative correlation with Let-7b levels. These findings were corroborated in HEK cell lines, where Spirulina induced a positive correlation between tyrosinase and MHC class II, and Rhodiola rosea exhibited a negative correlation between adipsin and Let-7b.   Further analysis in patient-derived models demonstrated that Let-7b binds to adipsin and tyrosinase, with a positive correlation between Let-7b and MHC class II. Notably, adipsin was found to associate with both tyrosinase and MHC class II, and a negative correlation was observed between adipsin and Let-7b. These interactions suggest a regulatory feedback loop involving these genes, with Spirulina and Rhodiola rosea acting as modulators. The study also highlights the role of yeast as a model system for understanding these interactions, with multiple instances of Spirulina and yeast mentioned in the context of gene expression profiling. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Spirulina and Rhodiola rosea, with implications for their therapeutic potential in conditions involving oxidative stress and immune regulation.

47849677|t|Genetic and microbial interactions in oral health: associations between sequence variants, gene products, and organism taxa in oral stereotypies and denta
47849677|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic factors and microbial communities in the development of oral health conditions. This study investigates the associations between sequence variants, gene products, and organism taxa in the context of oral stereotypies and dental caries. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed a positive correlation between the sequence variant rs2274700 and oral stereotypies, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to these behaviors. Additionally, the sequence variant G7958A was found to have a positive correlation with dental caries, indicating a possible role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Notably, there was also a positive correlation between dental caries and rs2274700, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between these genetic factors.   Further, the study explored the relationship between gene products and microbial taxa. A negative correlation was observed between uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 and the gene product ERG, implying a regulatory interaction that may influence metabolic processes. The gene product vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A was found to be associated with multiple organism taxa, including DEN-4, E. coli, and tobacco, suggesting a role in immune responses and inflammation.   Microbial analysis revealed that the organism taxon Spirulina was significantly associated with oral stereotypies, while the organism taxon yeast showed a positive correlation with dental caries. The organism taxon cats was found to be linked to both oral stereotypies and VEGF-A expression, possibly through environmental or behavioral factors. The organism taxon Drosophila was associated with the gene product IFT27, highlighting potential evolutionary conservation of gene function.   The organism taxon tobacco was found to be linked to multiple gene products, including VEGF-A and ERG, suggesting a role in modulating gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. The organism taxon E. coli was associated with both oral stereotypies and dental caries, indicating a possible microbial contribution to these conditions.   These findings underscore the importance of integrating genetic, microbial, and environmental factors in understanding the etiology of oral health conditions. The study provides a comprehensive framework for future research into the molecular and ecological mechanisms underlying these complex interactions.

This study investigates the potential role of sequence variants V89L and rs4828037 in the POLG gene, which is known to be associated with Alkaptonuria and immune reconstitution syndrome. The presence of multiple instances of the sequence variant V89L in Spirulina-exposed individuals suggests a possible interaction between Spirulina and the POLG gene. Furthermore, the association between Alkaptonuria and POLG is supported by the frequent occurrence of the rs4828037 variant in patients with this condition. Similarly, the link between immune reconstitution syndrome and POLG is reinforced by the co-occurrence of the V89L variant in both immune reconstitution syndrome cases and individuals with Alkaptonuria. The study also highlights the potential of Spirulina as a modulator of POLG function, with implications for the management of Alkaptonuria and immune reconstitution syndrome. These findings suggest that the interplay between Spirulina, sequence variants V89L and rs4828037, and the POLG gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alkaptonuria and immune reconstitution syndrome.

83662725|t|Vps2, c-Fos, and MAP9: Interactions with Kras, vimentin, and NOX4 in H9c2 and Capan1 ce
83662725|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and functional relationships between the gene products Vps2, c-Fos, and MAP9, and their associations with the oncogene Kras, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin, and the NADPH oxidase subunit NOX4 in the context of H9c2 and Capan1 cell lines. We demonstrate a positive correlation between MAP9 and Kras, suggesting a potential regulatory role of Kras in MAP9 expression. Additionally, we find an association between the sequence variant 1284A>C and Vps2, indicating a possible functional impact of this variant on Vps2 activity. The negative correlation between vimentin and Kras is further supported by the positive correlation between vimentin and MAP9, suggesting a complex regulatory network involving these proteins.   We also report a strong association between c-Fos and Kras, with evidence of a direct bind between vimentin and c-Fos, highlighting potential cross-talk between these signaling pathways. The positive correlation between vimentin and NOX4, along with the association between NOX4 and NR2F1, suggests a coordinated regulation of these genes in cellular stress responses. Furthermore, the negative correlation between NR2F1 and Thyroid hormone receptor a indicates a potential antagonistic relationship between these transcription factors.   Our findings are validated across multiple cell lines, including H9c2, Capan1, and LbetaT2, and are supported by the presence of sequence variants such as G1103R, L50R, and rs2073601, which may contribute to the observed phenotypic variations. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between these genes and their variants in cellular processes.

83855788|t|Tritium exposure and genetic variants in Reis-Bucklers dystrophy, soft tissue sarcoma, and musculoskeletal pain: a multi-phenoty
83855788|a|This study investigates the association between tritium exposure and multiple genetic variants across a range of phenotypic features, including Reis-Bucklers dystrophy, soft tissue sarcoma, and musculoskeletal pain. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, was found to exhibit significant positive correlations with several sequence variants, including g.3395C>T, L490R, c.920T>G, c.1239 +1G>A, 1494del6, rs12910509, and multiple instances of c.920T>G. These associations suggest a potential role for tritium in modulating genetic expression or stability in these conditions.   The study also reports a positive correlation between tritium and WFS, cortical dysplasia, and musculoskeletal pain, indicating that tritium may influence the pathogenesis of these phenotypic features. Notably, Reis-Bucklers dystrophy was found to be positively correlated with tritium, suggesting a possible environmental-genetic interaction in the development of this rare corneal dystrophy.   In addition to these associations, the study explores the impact of tritium on bacterial populations, revealing that tritium exposure may alter microbial community composition and function. This finding opens new avenues for understanding the interplay between environmental factors and genetic predispositions in complex diseases. The results highlight the importance of considering environmental exposures, such as tritium, in the context of genetic variability and phenotypic outcomes.

14533030|t|C4A, Liver kinase B1, and Stat5: genetic and functional interactions in human immunodeficiency virus-infected DU145 and CD18/HPAF ce
14533030|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional interactions between the gene C4A, Liver kinase B1, and Stat5 in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We analyzed the expression patterns and functional roles of these genes in HIV-infected DU145 and CD18/HPAF cell lines, as well as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected primary cells. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between C4A and Stat5, suggesting that C4A may act as a suppressor of Stat5 activity. Additionally, we observed an association between the sequence variant 30delG and both Stat5 and C4A, indicating that this variant may influence the expression or function of these genes. The sequence variant g.2839T>G was also found to be associated with Stat5, further supporting the role of genetic variability in modulating Stat5 activity. The sequence variant Ile/Val was linked to Stat5, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of its signaling pathways. Furthermore, the sequence variant L180M was associated with C4A, highlighting the importance of amino acid substitutions in determining gene function. In contrast, the sequence variant L180M showed a negative correlation with Liver kinase B1, indicating a possible antagonistic relationship between these two genes. The negative correlation between Liver kinase B1 and Stat5 suggests that Liver kinase B1 may act as a negative regulator of Stat5 signaling. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between C4A, Liver kinase B1, and Stat5 in the context of HIV infection. The study also highlights the importance of genetic variability in shaping the functional outcomes of these genes in different cell line models, including DU145, CD18/HPAF, and HL-7702 cells. The results have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of HIV-related diseases and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

16124622|t|Genetic Variants in LPA1 and KIM-1 Modulate Dyspnea and Interact with E. coli-Induced Pathways in PA-1 and IEC-6 Ce
16124622|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying dyspnea in the context of genetic variants in the LPA1 and KIM-1 genes, with a focus on their interactions with E. coli and their expression in PA-1 and IEC-6 cell lines. Dyspnea was observed to be positively correlated with the sequence variants p.G705RfsX16, R211H, and p.W111X, suggesting a potential role for these variants in the pathophysiology of respiratory distress. The association between LPA1 and dyspnea was further supported by a positive correlation between LPA1 expression and the presence of dyspnea, as well as a direct association between LPA1 and KIM-1. The sequence variant p.G705RfsX16 was found to be associated with LPA1, while R211H and p.W111X were also linked to LPA1, indicating a complex regulatory network involving these genes. Additionally, p.W111X was associated with KIM-1, and there was a positive correlation between KIM-1 and dyspnea, reinforcing the role of KIM-1 in respiratory function. The interaction between KIM-1 and LPA1 was further supported by a direct binding event, suggesting a potential functional relationship between these two genes. The study also examined the impact of E. coli on these pathways, with E. coli being present in 4 instances across the dataset. The cell lines PA-1 and IEC-6 were used to model these interactions, with PA-1 being mentioned 8 times and IEC-6 appearing 3 times. The findings highlight the importance of genetic variants in modulating dyspnea and their potential role in disease progression, particularly in the context of E. coli infection and cellular responses in PA-1 and IEC-6 cell lines.

25693586|t|Investigating the therapeutic conversion between rilmenidine and sorafenib in the context of retinal degeneration and the genetic associations of sequence variants in Ishikawa and HeLa ce
25693586|a|This study explores the therapeutic conversion between rilmenidine and sorafenib in the context of retinal degeneration and their potential applications in treating lymphoreticular malignancies. We investigated the pharmacological interactions between these two chemical entities in both Ishikawa and HeLa cell lines, which are widely used in cancer research. The results suggest a significant conversion mechanism between rilmenidine and sorafenib, which may have implications for the treatment of retinal degeneration and related diseases.   Further, we examined the genetic associations of several sequence variants, including c.463-6T>G, rs2073162, p.R246Q, and c.715_717delGTC, in relation to retinal degeneration and lymphoreticular malignancies. Our findings reveal a strong association between c.463-6T>G and rs2073162, as well as between p.R246Q and rs2073162, indicating a potential functional link between these variants. These associations were further validated using MC3T3-E1 and Ishikawa cell lines, which demonstrated consistent expression patterns across multiple experimental conditions.  Additionally, we explored the conversion between sorafenib and Clonidine, which may provide new insights into the pharmacological management of retinal degeneration. The study also included multiple instances of the chemical entity 'ester' in the context of drug metabolism and the role of these compounds in modulating cellular responses in the presence of specific sequence variants. The results highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between chemical entities and genetic factors in the development of targeted therapies for retinal degeneration and related conditions.

66757610|t|DNA polymerase gamma and c-Fos: interactions with steroid, penicillin-G potassium, and dimethyl sulphoxide in C. elegans and bovin
66757610|a|Recent studies have explored the functional interactions between DNA polymerase gamma and c-Fos in the context of steroid metabolism and antibiotic exposure. In C. elegans, DNA polymerase gamma was found to exhibit altered activity in the presence of the sequence variant 1469T->G, which was associated with increased sensitivity to steroid exposure. Similarly, in bovine models, the sequence variant A118D was linked to a significant reduction in the expression of c-Fos, suggesting a potential regulatory role in response to steroid and penicillin-G potassium.    The drug interaction between steroid and dimethyl sulphoxide was observed in both C. elegans and bovine systems, with dimethyl sulphoxide enhancing the bioavailability of steroid compounds. This effect was further supported by the drug interaction between steroid and penicillin-G potassium, which was found to modulate the pharmacokinetics of both agents in bovine tissues. Additionally, the drug interaction between dimethyl sulphoxide and penicillin-G potassium was noted, with dimethyl sulphoxide potentially reducing the renal clearance of penicillin-G potassium in C. elegans.    A negative correlation was identified between c-Fos and dimethyl sulphoxide in bovine liver tissue, suggesting that dimethyl sulphoxide may inhibit the transcriptional activity of c-Fos. This finding was consistent across multiple experimental conditions, including the presence of the sequence variant 1469T->G. The study also highlighted the importance of DNA polymerase gamma in maintaining genomic stability under conditions of steroid and antibiotic exposure, with the sequence variant A118D playing a critical role in this process.    These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between DNA polymerase gamma, c-Fos, steroid, penicillin-G potassium, and dimethyl sulphoxide in both C. elegans and bovine models.

38895329|t|Functional and Structural Interactions of Tryptophan Hydroxylase with Curcumin and Collagenase in the Context of West Nile Virus I
38895329|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between host immune responses and viral pathogenesis, particularly in the context of West Nile virus (WNV) infection. This research explores the molecular interactions between tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), a key enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis, and two bioactive compounds, Curcumin and collagenase, in the context of WNV infection. The study reveals that Curcumin and collagenase exhibit both comparative and conversional relationships, suggesting potential therapeutic applications in modulating immune responses.   Curcumin was found to bind to TPH, thereby modulating its enzymatic activity, while collagenase also demonstrated a binding affinity for TPH, indicating a possible role in the regulation of tryptophan metabolism during viral infection. The association between Curcumin and TPH was further supported by evidence of drug interaction between Curcumin and collagenase, which may influence the efficacy of both compounds in immune modulation.   Interestingly, the sequence variant p.R246Q in TPH was identified as a potential marker of altered enzyme function, and the presence of a single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide was observed in multiple TPH alleles, suggesting genetic variability in the response to these compounds. The study also demonstrated that collagenase and Curcumin exhibit mutual association and conversion, with collagenase being able to convert Curcumin into a more bioavailable form, and vice versa.   These findings provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between TPH, Curcumin, and collagenase in the context of WNV infection, and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

45911372|t|Capan1 cell line and Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome: genetic interactions involving LIF, CYPB11B2, Smad2/3, raptor, Spry 1, and sequence 
45911372|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome in the context of the Capan1 cell line. We report a positive correlation between Spry 1 and LIF, suggesting a potential regulatory role of Spry 1 in LIF signaling. Additionally, a positive correlation between raptor and Spry 1 is observed, while a negative correlation between raptor and Spry 1 is also noted, indicating complex regulatory networks. The association between LIF and CYPB11B2 suggests a possible functional link between these two gene products in the disease context.   We further demonstrate a negative correlation between Smad2/3 and raptor, and a negative correlation between CYPB11B2 and Smad2/3, highlighting the interplay between these signaling pathways. The positive correlation between Smad2/3 and raptor is consistent with the observed negative correlation between Smad2/3 and CYPB11B2, suggesting a regulatory hierarchy.   Genetic variants play a significant role in this study. The association between rs713041 and c.1239 +1G>A, as well as between rs713041 and delta32, indicates potential functional relationships among these sequence variants. The association between A442V and c.1239 +1G>A, and between c.1094C>T and Y245X, further supports the involvement of these variants in the disease mechanism.   The negative correlation between Spry 1 and CYPB11B2 suggests a possible antagonistic relationship between these two gene products. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the genetic and molecular interactions in Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, with implications for understanding the role of the Capan1 cell line in disease progression.

60635009|t|Collagen SH and 5-FU interactions in postoperative nausea and vomiting: a study on DEN-4 infection and molecular me
60635009|a|Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) has been increasingly linked to molecular pathways involving collagen SH and the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU. This study explores the complex interplay between these entities in the context of DEN-4 viral infection. We hypothesize that collagen SH may play a critical role in modulating the severity of PONV, while 5-FU may exert a negative correlation with collagen SH expression.   Our findings reveal a significant negative correlation between 5-FU and collagen SH, suggesting that 5-FU may inhibit collagen SH activity. Additionally, we observed a strong association between postoperative nausea and vomiting and collagen SH, indicating that collagen SH may be a key mediator in the pathophysiology of PONV. Furthermore, the association between postoperative nausea and vomiting and 5-FU was confirmed through multiple experimental models, highlighting the potential dual role of 5-FU in both exacerbating and mitigating PONV.   A direct bind between 5-FU and collagen SH was identified using molecular docking and biochemical assays, providing evidence for a potential molecular mechanism underlying these interactions. The study also examined the role of DEN-4 in this context, as the virus was found to upregulate collagen SH expression, which in turn may contribute to the development of PONV.   These results suggest that collagen SH and 5-FU are intricately linked in the context of postoperative nausea and vomiting, with DEN-4 infection potentially modulating this relationship. Further research is warranted to explore the therapeutic implications of these findings in clinical settings.

80662073|t|Genetic Variants and Disease Associations in cIAP1, OATP1B1, Toll-like Receptor 4, and Related 
80662073|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease susceptibility, particularly in the context of inflammatory and metabolic disorders. This study investigates the associations between specific sequence variants and disease phenotypes, with a focus on cIAP1, OATP1B1, toll-like receptor 4, and their functional implications.   The rs1155974 variant was found to exhibit a positive correlation with both GIST and brain edema, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Additionally, the 521T>C variant showed a positive correlation with isolated micropenis, indicating a possible genetic link to developmental anomalies. In contrast, the negative correlation between GIST and OATP1B1 suggests that OATP1B1 may act as a protective factor against the development of GIST.   Further, the study revealed a negative correlation between anti-inflammatory cytokines and toll-like receptor 4, implying that the activation of toll-like receptor 4 may suppress the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to chronic inflammation. The sequence variant Delta695-725 was associated with multiple disease outcomes, including strokes and brain edema, while the variant D542A was linked to an increased risk of strokes.   The variant K294E was found to be associated with anemia, and the variant c.1074G>T was correlated with strokes. The sequence variant (GCG)6(GCA)3GCG was replaced by (GCG)6(GCA)(GCG)4(GCA)3GCG, which was associated with a unique pattern of disease expression.   Moreover, the gene product a-SMA was found to be upregulated in the context of brain edema, and Keratin 12 was associated with isolated micropenis. The gene Socs3 was found to be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, with a negative correlation observed between Socs3 and toll-like receptor 4.   These findings underscore the importance of genetic variants in modulating disease risk and highlight the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.

06657049|t|Genetic and functional interactions of sequence variants with Ppg in multiple ce
06657049|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic interactions between sequence variants and the chemical entity Ppg across multiple cell lines. We focused on the associations between rs757229 and lysine at residue 223, as well as the complex network of relationships involving rs6235, rs5966709, and I280S. Our findings reveal a significant positive correlation between rs757229 and Ppg, as well as between rs5966709 and Ppg, suggesting that these sequence variants may modulate Ppg activity in different cellular contexts.   Using a panel of cell lines including Capan1, LbetaT2, LNCaP, COS-7, MEF, CMT-93, and Mz-ChA-1, we observed that rs757229 is associated with both lysine at residue 223 and rs6235, while rs6235 is linked to rs5966709 and I280S. Notably, I280S shows a positive correlation with Ppg and is also associated with rs6235 and rs757229. Additionally, lysine at residue 223 is connected to rs757229, rs6235, and rs5966709, highlighting its central role in this genetic network.   Our results suggest that these sequence variants may influence Ppg function through shared regulatory mechanisms, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular pathways involved. The observed associations provide a foundation for understanding the genetic basis of Ppg-related phenotypes in diverse cellular environments.

85736158|t|Imatinib, HIV co-infection, and Darier's disease: a complex interplay with bacterial and DEN-2 virus inte
85736158|a|Recent studies have explored the multifaceted interactions between imatinib, HIV co-infection, and Darier's disease, with particular attention to their associations with bacterial and DEN-2 virus populations. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to exhibit a negative correlation with HIV co-infection, suggesting that its use may reduce the risk of HIV progression in certain patient populations. This finding is supported by multiple clinical and pharmacological studies that demonstrate imatinib's ability to modulate immune responses and viral replication. However, the same drug has also been associated with a negative correlation with Darier's disease, a rare genetic skin disorder, indicating potential off-target effects or immune-related mechanisms. These findings are further complicated by the presence of bacteria and DEN-2 virus, which appear to influence the disease outcomes in both HIV co-infection and Darier's disease. The presence of bacteria has been linked to increased inflammation and immune dysregulation, while DEN-2 virus has been implicated in exacerbating the clinical manifestations of both conditions. Collectively, these studies highlight the complex interplay between imatinib, HIV co-infection, Darier's disease, bacteria, and DEN-2 virus, underscoring the need for further research to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and therapeutic implications.

77628930|t|Genetic variants in the low-density lipoprotein receptor and sulfonylurea receptor: implications for lymphomagenesis, diabetes insipidus, and opiate addiction in C57BL/6 and hRPTEC ce
77628930|a|This study investigates the functional and phenotypic consequences of the c.640_667del28 sequence variant in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and its potential role in modulating disease susceptibility. The c.640_667del28 variant was identified in multiple C57BL/6 and hRPTEC cell lines, and its impact on cellular lipid metabolism and immune signaling was assessed. Notably, the variant was associated with altered expression levels of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), suggesting a potential mechanism linking genetic variability to lymphomagenesis.    Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between opiate addiction and the expression of the sulfonylurea receptor, as evidenced by increased SUR activity in C57BL/6 mice exposed to opiate compounds. This finding was corroborated by transcriptomic profiling of hRPTEC cells, where the c.640_667del28 variant was linked to upregulated SUR expression in the context of opiate exposure.    In parallel, the study explored the relationship between diabetes insipidus and the cytokine IL-6. The c.640_667del28 variant was found to enhance IL-6 secretion in hRPTEC cells, and this effect was further amplified in the presence of the myogenic factor 5 (MRF5) gene product. This positive correlation between diabetes insipidus and IL-6 was supported by in vivo experiments in C57BL/6 mice, where IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in animals with the variant.    The study also examined the interplay between the low-density lipoprotein receptor and the sulfonylurea receptor in the context of lymphomagenesis. The c.640_667del28 variant was found to disrupt normal receptor interactions, leading to increased cellular proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in C57BL/6-derived lymphoma cell lines. These findings suggest that the variant may contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphomagenesis through dysregulated signaling pathways involving both LDLR and SUR.    Overall, the results highlight the complex genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between the c.640_667del28 variant, the sulfonylurea receptor, IL-6, and various disease states, including opiate addiction, diabetes insipidus, and lymphomagenesis.

24038133|t|Genetic Variants in Nephrin and TUBA1A: Associations with Disease Phenotypes and Cellular Responses in Multiple Ce
24038133|a|This study investigates the functional and phenotypic consequences of several genetic variants in the nephrin and TUBA1A genes, with a focus on their associations with disease phenotypes and cellular responses in multiple cell lines. The research highlights the role of the sequence variant p.W111X in the nephrin gene, which is linked to the development of ARM syndrome. Additionally, the variant p.Arg58fs is associated with erythema, while the c.1146+25insA insertion is found to be correlated with both erythema and inflammation of the liver capsule. The G>T substitution at nucleotide c.898 and the g.3455_3460del variant are also examined for their potential impact on disease progression.   The study further explores the association between the sequence variant (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 and hypercholesterolemia, providing evidence for its role in lipid metabolism. The 1284A>C variant is found to be strongly associated with FDH, suggesting a potential genetic basis for this condition. Nail dystrophy is also observed in individuals carrying the p.W111X variant, reinforcing the pleiotropic effects of mutations in the nephrin gene.   In addition to these findings, the study evaluates the role of the TUBA1A gene in cellular processes, with the 1284A>C variant showing a significant association with FDH. The gene product VASP is also implicated in the pathogenesis of hypercholesterolemia, as evidenced by the (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 variant.   To assess the functional impact of these variants, the study employs multiple cell lines, including Mz-ChA-1, COS-7, HK-2, and BALB/c. The results demonstrate that the c.1146+25insA variant is not only associated with erythema but also with inflammation of the liver capsule, suggesting a broader role in immune-related pathologies. The study also identifies the Pum gene as a potential modifier of these genetic effects, with two instances of the Pum gene product being observed in the experimental setup.   Overall, this research provides a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and phenotypic relationships between various sequence variants and disease states, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

39364100|t|FGFR1 and myoglobinuria: genetic variants, sequence polymorphisms, and interactions with topiramate in tobacco and bovin
39364100|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene and the development of myoglobinuria, particularly in tobacco-exposed individuals. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying this association, with a focus on sequence variants and their functional consequences. Three distinct sequence variants, including the A/G transition at -1,071 bp, the c.643T>C polymorphism, and the CAG repeat expansion, were analyzed in both tobacco and bovine models.   The findings reveal a significant association between FGFR1 and myoglobinuria, with the A/G transition at -1,071 bp showing a strong correlation with the condition. Additionally, the c.643T>C variant was found to have a negative correlation with topiramate treatment, suggesting a potential pharmacogenetic interaction. Similarly, the CAG repeat expansion also exhibited a negative correlation with topiramate, indicating that these genetic variants may modulate the drug's efficacy or side effect profile.   Interestingly, topiramate was found to be associated with both the c.643T>C and CAG repeat variants, as well as the A/G transition at -1,071 bp, suggesting a complex regulatory network involving these genetic elements. These results provide new insights into the genetic basis of myoglobinuria and the role of topiramate in modulating its expression, particularly in tobacco and bovine systems. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings in larger cohorts and to explore their clinical implications.

82379415|t|Vitamin C, GSH, and their interactions with rabbit-derived cell lines and gene products in the context of Daucus carota and MCF-
82379415|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between Vitamin C and GSH in the context of rabbit-derived cell lines and their effects on gene expression profiles. Using MCF-7 and KU7 cell lines, we demonstrate that Vitamin C and GSH exhibit a bidirectional drug interaction, where each compound modulates the activity of the other. These interactions are further explored in the presence of rabbit-derived cell lines, which show distinct responses to the combined treatment. The study also examines the role of the LPA1 gene in mediating these interactions, with particular emphasis on its expression in MCF-7 and 293T cells.   In addition, we assess the impact of Vitamin C and GSH on the expression of PAKs, ATF2, and VEGF receptor 2 in rabbit and Daucus carota-derived cell lines. Our findings suggest that the presence of Vitamin C and GSH significantly alters the expression levels of these genes, with notable effects observed in the 293T and KU7 cell lines. The study further highlights the importance of rabbit models in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions, as well as the potential therapeutic applications of Vitamin C and GSH in modulating gene expression in cancer-related pathways.   The results provide strong evidence for the drug interaction between Vitamin C and GSH, with both compounds showing mutual enhancement in their biological activities. These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting gene expression in rabbit and Daucus carota models, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders.

09243950|t|Complex Interactions of GI-hormones, Simvastatin-ezetimibe, and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in S. cerevisiae, Danio rerio, and Chic
09243950|a|This study explores the intricate relationships between GI-hormones, Simvastatin-ezetimibe, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) across multiple biological systems, including S. cerevisiae, Danio rerio, and chick models. We investigated the drug interactions and correlations between these entities in various cell lines, including SMMC-7721, HeLa, CD18/HPAF, SCID-HuH-7, and DUCaP. Additionally, we examined the binding interactions between U-II and caspase-8, as well as between U-II and cyclin D1 and D2.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between Simvastatin-ezetimibe and KCl, as well as between KCl and S-1. Furthermore, there is a negative correlation between GI-hormones and antiarrhythmic drugs, and between S-1 and GI-hormones. The drug interaction between Simvastatin-ezetimibe and GI-hormones is significant, as is the interaction between GI-hormones and S-1. Notably, there is a negative correlation between S-1 and Simvastatin-ezetimibe, and between S-1 and SSRIs.   The drug interaction between SSRIs and GI-hormones, as well as between SSRIs and S-1, was also observed. Additionally, KCl exhibits a drug interaction with both Simvastatin-ezetimibe and SSRIs, while S-1 shows a drug interaction with KCl and GI-hormones. The binding of U-II to caspase-8 and cyclin D1 and D2 was confirmed through biochemical assays.   These results highlight the complex interplay between these chemical entities and their potential implications in cellular signaling and disease mechanisms across diverse organisms, including S. cerevisiae, Danio rerio, and chick. The study also underscores the importance of understanding these interactions in the context of multiple cell lines, such as SMMC-7721, HeLa, CD18/HPAF, SCID-HuH-7, and DUCaP, for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

20397465|t|ARID1B and rs1410996: complex associations with myocarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in chick and bacteria
20397465|a|This study investigates the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between the ARID1B gene, the sequence variant rs1410996, and several disease phenotypes, including myocarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and abnormal glucose homeostasis, across multiple organismal models. Using chick and bacterial systems, we demonstrate that ARID1B is significantly associated with abnormal glucose homeostasis, with both direct and indirect evidence supporting this relationship. Furthermore, we find that rs1410996 is strongly associated with myocarditis, and this association is reinforced by its correlation with left ventricular hypertrophy. Notably, the sequence variant rs1410996 also shows a significant association with abnormal glucose homeostasis, suggesting a potential pleiotropic effect. In contrast, the relationship between ARID1B and left ventricular hypertrophy is complex, with both positive and negative correlations observed, indicating a nuanced regulatory mechanism. Similarly, the association between ARID1B and myocarditis is not uniform, with some evidence of a negative correlation. These findings highlight the multifaceted role of ARID1B and rs1410996 in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and their potential as therapeutic targets in chick and bacterial models. The results also suggest that the interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes is highly context-dependent, requiring further investigation in diverse biological systems.

18398923|t|Genetic and functional analysis of epsinR, EP4, and miR-138 in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia and congenital malfo
18398923|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional relationships between the sequence variant 1665delC, the gene product epsinR, the gene product EP4, the microRNA miR-138, and their associations with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, congenital malformations, and enzymatic complex I-deficient conditions. Using a combination of genetic screening, cell line-based assays, and functional genomics, we demonstrate that the sequence variant 1665delC is positively correlated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, suggesting a potential causal role in disease pathogenesis. In contrast, epsinR exhibits a negative correlation with congenital malformations, indicating a protective effect against these developmental defects. Furthermore, miR-138 shows a positive correlation with EP4, highlighting a regulatory interaction between these two molecules. Notably, the association between EP4 and congenital malformations suggests a potential role for EP4 in developmental processes. Additionally, the negative correlation between epsinR and enzymatic complex I-deficient conditions implies a functional link between epsinR and mitochondrial function. The sequence variant c.463-6T>G is also found to be negatively correlated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, suggesting a possible antagonistic effect. These findings were validated using the RAW 264.7 and MCF-7 cell lines, where the expression patterns of epsinR, EP4, and miR-138 were analyzed under various experimental conditions. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex diseases and highlight potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

14306746|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of bupivacaine, ZnSO(4), and Fluo3 in DU145 and GT1-1 cell lines under mouse mammary tumor virus co
14306746|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the chemical entities bupivacaine, ZnSO(4), and Fluo3, as well as their genetic and cellular associations with the sequence variant rs1800896 in the context of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infection. The research focuses on the DU145 and GT1-1 cell lines, which are frequently used in cancer and neuroendocrine studies.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between rs1800896 and bupivacaine, suggesting that genetic variability at this locus may modulate the pharmacological response to bupivacaine. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between bupivacaine and ZnSO(4), indicating a potential synergistic effect of these two compounds. However, a negative correlation was also noted between bupivacaine and ZnSO(4), highlighting the complexity of their interactions.   The association between bupivacaine and rs1800896 further supports the hypothesis that genetic factors may influence drug efficacy and toxicity. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between ZnSO(4) and rs1800896, suggesting that this sequence variant may play a role in modulating the cellular response to ZnSO(4).   In the context of Fluo3, we identified a positive correlation between Fluo3 and ZnSO(4), which may have implications for calcium signaling and cellular imaging. However, a negative correlation was also observed between Fluo3 and ZnSO(4), indicating that the relationship is not straightforward. Furthermore, a negative correlation between Fluo3 and organophosphorus was noted, suggesting that these two compounds may compete for cellular uptake or metabolic pathways.   The study also found a positive correlation between bupivacaine and organophosphorus, which may have therapeutic implications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. These findings collectively suggest that the interactions between these chemical entities and genetic variants are highly context-dependent and may be influenced by the cellular environment, particularly in the presence of MMTV.   The results provide a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and their potential applications in drug development and personalized medicine.

94596711|t|Genetic Variants and Viral Pathogenesis: Interactions Between -4825 Gene Insertion/Deletion, D401H, and Host Immune Responses in Horses, Rhesus Monkeys, and Human Immunodeficien
94596711|a|This study investigates the genetic and virological interactions between the -4825 gene insertion/deletion variant, the D401H sequence variant, and their associations with host immune responses in horses, rhesus monkeys, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The -4825 gene insertion/deletion variant was found to be significantly associated with the D401H sequence variant in multiple experimental models, including in vitro studies using the 293T cell line. These findings suggest a potential functional link between these two genetic variants in modulating viral replication and immune evasion. In horses, the -4825 gene insertion/deletion variant was observed to influence the expression of key immune-related genes, while in rhesus monkeys, the D401H variant was linked to altered viral load dynamics. In HIV-infected individuals, both the -4825 gene insertion/deletion and D401H variants were found to be associated with differential immune responses, including T-cell activation and cytokine production. The 293T cell line was used extensively to model these interactions, revealing that the presence of the -4825 gene insertion/deletion variant enhanced the replication efficiency of HIV in the presence of the D401H variant. These results highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and viral pathogenesis, with implications for understanding host-virus interactions in diverse species, including horses, rhesus monkeys, and humans infected with HIV. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations and their potential therapeutic applications.

18926391|t|Caveolin-1 and extracellular regulated protein kinase interactions in bovine and sheep models: implications for JNK signaling and NMDA receptor 1 re
18926391|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between caveolin-1 and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) in bovine and sheep cell lines, with particular emphasis on their role in modulating JNK signaling pathways and NMDA receptor 1 expression. Using C4-2B and C57BL/6J cell lines derived from bovine and sheep tissues, we demonstrate a direct binding interaction between caveolin-1 and ERK, which is further supported by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between ERK and JNK activity in these cell lines, suggesting a potential regulatory feedback loop that may influence cellular responses to stress and inflammation. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between caveolin-1 and NMDA receptor 1 expression in sheep-derived C4-2B cells, indicating a possible role for caveolin-1 in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. The study also includes in vitro experiments using HCT116 human colon cancer cells, where the presence of JNK and ERK was found to be significantly elevated in response to extracellular stimuli. These results are further validated in inpatient clinical samples from cats, where the expression levels of caveolin-1 and ERK were found to be positively correlated. The implications of these findings extend to the study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, where similar signaling pathways have been implicated in viral replication and immune evasion. Overall, this work provides new insights into the complex interplay between caveolin-1, ERK, JNK, and NMDA receptor 1 across multiple species, including tobacco and bovine models.

31150084|t|Genetic and biochemical interactions of ATX, uroplakin (UP) III, and TH in sheep and Drosophil
31150084|a|This study investigates the genetic and biochemical interactions between ATX, uroplakin (UP) III, and TH in both sheep and Drosophila models. We found a positive correlation between ATX and uroplakin (UP) III, suggesting a potential functional relationship between these two gene products. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between uroplakin (UP) III and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, indicating a possible regulatory mechanism. The association between Lys to Asn at position 198 and TH was confirmed through biochemical assays, and this variant was also linked to alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine.   We further explored the relationship between TH and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, identifying a drug interaction between these two chemical entities. The D allele for the -1607 was associated with TH, and this variant was also linked to alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine. The sequence variant rs1061170 showed associations with both TH and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, reinforcing the complex interplay between these factors.   A positive correlation was observed between TH and ATX, as well as between alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine and ATX. The association between TH and ATX was further supported by functional studies. The D90A variant was found to be associated with alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, highlighting the role of sequence variants in modulating these interactions. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between ATX, uroplakin (UP) III, TH, and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine in both sheep and Drosophila models.

27095137|a|This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological interactions of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, clozapine, and triamcinolone diacetate in the context of gene expression and cellular response in H9c2 and PA-1 cell lines. The sequence variant g.3318-35T>G was found to be associated with altered expression of the gene FBXO5, which is involved in the regulation of protein degradation. Additionally, the sequence variant C262T was linked to changes in the expression of CCDC149, a gene implicated in cellular signaling pathways. The organism taxon Daucus carota was used as a model system to study the effects of these chemical entities on gene expression and cellular function.   The cotreatment of clozapine with 15-F(2t)-IsoP was shown to significantly modulate the expression of Neurofibromin 1, a tumor suppressor gene, and to influence the activity of NFkB, a key transcription factor in inflammatory responses. Similarly, cotreatment of clozapine with triamcinolone diacetate was found to alter the expression of matriptase-2, a serine protease involved in epithelial cell function. The cotreatment of triamcinolone diacetate with clozapine was associated with changes in the expression of CCDC149 and the regulation of the gene product FBXO5.   Furthermore, the cotreatment of 15-F(2t)-IsoP with clozapine was found to have a synergistic effect on the expression of the gene product CCDC149, while the cotreatment of 15-F(2t)-IsoP with triamcinolone diacetate was associated with altered expression of the gene FBXO5. These findings suggest that the interactions between these chemical entities may have significant implications for the regulation of gene expression and cellular function in both H9c2 and PA-1 cell lines. The results also highlight the potential therapeutic applications of these compounds in the context of diseases involving inflammation and cellular signaling.

76854898|t|Chronic Renal Failure and Insomnia: Interactions with Cholesterol, Acrolein, and HOMER1 in Dengue Virus Type 2 and Aedes Mo
76854898|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between chronic renal failure, insomnia, and various chemical entities and genetic factors in the context of dengue virus type 2 infection and exposure to environmental toxins. Chronic renal failure was found to be significantly associated with both insomnia and acrolein exposure, with a notable negative correlation between acrolein and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The association between 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and insomnia was confirmed through longitudinal studies in rats and rabbit models.   Cholesterol levels were inversely correlated with both insomnia and extrapyramidal symptoms, suggesting a potential protective role of cholesterol in these conditions. A negative correlation was also observed between cholesterol and HOMER1, while a positive correlation was found between extrapyramidal symptoms and HOMER1. The gene product GIP was found to bind cholesterol, indicating a possible regulatory mechanism in lipid metabolism.   In Aedes mosquitoes, the presence of dengue virus type 2 was linked to increased levels of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which in turn was associated with chronic renal failure. Acrolein was found to be a key mediator in the pathogenesis of chronic renal failure, with a strong negative correlation between acrolein and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.   The study also highlights the role of HOMER1 in modulating extrapyramidal symptoms, with evidence of a positive correlation between HOMER1 and these symptoms. Furthermore, the negative correlation between cholesterol and extrapyramidal symptoms suggests a potential therapeutic target for managing these conditions.   Overall, the findings underscore the intricate relationships between environmental toxins, genetic factors, and disease phenotypes, particularly in the context of chronic renal failure, insomnia, and extrapyramidal symptoms.

21741582|t|Genetic Variants and Phenotypic Associations in Ginseng and Horses: Implications for Liver Toxicity and Testicular Dy
21741582|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants, cell lines, and disease features in ginseng and horses. We focus on the sequence variant c.640_667del28, which is associated with both liver toxicity and dysgenesis of the testes. The variant +3100 T/G shows a positive correlation with dysgenesis of the testes and is also associated with c.640_667del28. Additionally, lysine at residue 223 exhibits a negative correlation with liver toxicity and a negative correlation with dysgenesis of the testes, while also being associated with +3100 T/G. The cell lines PA-1, Ba/F3, and CA3 are used to model these genetic interactions in vitro. Our findings suggest that the sequence variant c.640_667del28 is negatively correlated with liver toxicity, and the variant +3100 T/G is positively correlated with dysgenesis of the testes. These associations are further supported by the observed relationships between lysine at residue 223 and both liver toxicity and dysgenesis of the testes. The study also highlights the potential role of ginseng and horses in understanding these genetic-phenotypic interactions, with implications for toxicology and developmental biology.

14790715|t|ErbB3, type I interferon, and NF1: complex interactions in inflammatory diseases, tissue injury, 
14790715|a|Recent studies have highlighted the intricate relationships between the gene product ErbB3, type I interferon, and NF1 in the context of inflammatory diseases, tissue injury, and ADCA. This research explores the multifaceted interactions among these molecular entities and their implications for disease progression.   ErbB3 has been shown to exhibit a negative correlation with tissue injury, suggesting that its expression may serve as a protective factor against inflammatory damage. Furthermore, type I interferon demonstrates a positive correlation with inflammatory diseases, reinforcing its role in immune response modulation. Notably, the gene product C2 is negatively correlated with both tissue injury and inflammatory diseases, indicating a potential regulatory role in these pathological processes.  The disease feature ADCA is positively correlated with NF1, suggesting a possible genetic link between these two entities. However, ADCA also shows a negative correlation with C2, highlighting the complexity of these interactions. Additionally, NF1 is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain, with a negative correlation observed between NF1 and postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain, indicating a possible protective effect of NF1 in this context.  Type I interferon exhibits a negative correlation with tissue injury, which aligns with its known anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, type I interferon binds to both BRCA1 and ErbB3, suggesting potential functional interactions that may influence disease outcomes. The gene product BRCA1 is also associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain, with a negative correlation observed between BRCA1 and postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain.  ErbB3 is positively correlated with inflammatory diseases and also binds to C2, indicating a possible role in the regulation of inflammatory responses. The gene product C2 is negatively correlated with inflammatory diseases, further supporting its involvement in immune regulation.   These findings underscore the complex interplay between genetic factors and disease phenotypes, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammatory diseases, tissue injury, and ADCA. The results suggest that targeting these molecular interactions may offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing these conditions.

45077047|t|IVS3 + 18C > T and GnRH: implications for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in RAW 264.7 and BALB/c ce
45077047|a|Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) has been linked to specific sequence variants, including IVS3 + 18C > T, which appears to influence both lipid metabolism and GnRH signaling. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between IVS3 + 18C > T and ADH, with a focus on the role of GnRH in modulating disease progression. Using RAW 264.7 and BALB/c cell lines, we demonstrate that the IVS3 + 18C > T variant is significantly associated with ADH, as evidenced by altered lipid profiles and increased expression of GnRH-related pathways. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between GnRH levels and the severity of ADH, suggesting that GnRH may act as a downstream mediator of the disease. Our findings provide evidence for a direct association between IVS3 + 18C > T and ADH, as well as a functional link between IVS3 + 18C > T and GnRH. These results highlight the potential of targeting GnRH signaling as a therapeutic strategy for managing ADH in both RAW 264.7 and BALB/c models. The study also underscores the importance of cell line-specific responses in understanding the genetic and molecular basis of ADH.

52330168|t|Genetic and pharmacological modulation of GnRH receptor function: interactions with sequence variants, chemical entities, and gene 
52330168|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and gene products in modulating the function of the GnRH receptor and its downstream signaling pathways. We focus on the sequence variant '144 G>A' and its association with the GnRH receptor, as well as the sequence variants 'P29S' and 'S75X', which show significant associations with the GnRH receptor. Additionally, the sequence variant 'alanine for proline at amino acid 286' is found to be highly prevalent in our cohort, suggesting a potential role in receptor function.   The chemical entity 'reserpine' is shown to bind to the gene product TXN2, and this interaction is further supported by an association between reserpine and the gene product BMPRIB. The gene product TXN2 also binds to ABCG2, and there is a negative correlation between ABCG2 and ROCK-I/II. The gene product AMT is found to bind to both ROCK-I/II and the GnRH receptor, with a negative correlation between AMT and ROCK-I/II, as well as between AMT and TXN2.   The chemical entity 'L-365,260' is cotreated with 'epipodophyllotoxin', and both are associated with the gene product BMPRIB. Furthermore, 'L-365,260' is also associated with 'Garcinielliptone FC', which itself is associated with the GnRH receptor. The chemical entity 'Garcinielliptone FC' is found to have a strong association with the GnRH receptor, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in modulating its activity.   The chemical entity 'buprenorphine' is used as a control in our pharmacological studies, and it is found to have no significant interaction with the GnRH receptor or its associated gene products. The chemical entity 'reserpine' is also found to have a significant association with the gene product BMPRIB, reinforcing its role in modulating receptor function.   Our findings highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants, chemical entities, and gene products in the regulation of GnRH receptor function, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting these interactions.

93515313|t|Ba/F3 cell line responses to galactose and lamivudine in the context of IVS3+1G>A sequence variant and rDEN2 
93515313|a|This study investigates the interactions between the Ba/F3 cell line, the sequence variant IVS3+1G>A, and the chemical entities galactose and lamivudine in the context of the rDEN2 organism. The Ba/F3 cell line was exposed to varying concentrations of galactose and lamivudine, and the effects on cellular metabolism and gene expression were analyzed. The results revealed a complex interplay between these factors. A negative correlation was observed between lamivudine and galactose, suggesting that their presence may inhibit each other's metabolic pathways. Conversely, a positive correlation was found between galactose and lamivudine, indicating that they may share common metabolic routes or regulatory mechanisms. The sequence variant IVS3+1G>A showed a positive correlation with both galactose and lamivudine, suggesting that this variant may influence the expression or activity of genes involved in their metabolism. Additionally, a negative correlation was noted between IVS3+1G>A and galactose, indicating potential regulatory interactions. The conversion between lamivudine and galactose was also observed, highlighting the dynamic nature of their metabolic interconversion. The rDEN2 organism was found to be a key player in these interactions, with its taxonomic classification influencing the observed correlations. The Ba/F3 cell line served as a critical model for understanding these relationships, with multiple instances of the cell line being used to ensure reproducibility and robustness of the findings. The study underscores the importance of considering both genetic and metabolic factors in the context of the rDEN2 organism when analyzing the interactions between galactose, lamivudine, and the IVS3+1G>A sequence variant.

46348914|t|Genetic variants in IFN and their associations with NAFLD, dibucaine response, and sequence variants in MES-SA/D
46348914|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, disease states, and cellular responses in the context of NAFLD and dibucaine treatment. Using the MES-SA/Dx5 cell line, we examined the effects of sequence variants 192RR and V274I on the expression and function of the IFN gene product. Our findings reveal a significant association between the 192RR variant and IFN expression, as well as a strong positive correlation between NAFLD and the 192RR variant. Additionally, we observed a direct association between V274I and 192RR, suggesting a potential functional link between these sequence variants. The V274I variant was also found to be associated with IFN, further supporting the role of these genetic changes in modulating immune responses. Notably, dibucaine showed a positive correlation with IFN levels, indicating a possible therapeutic role in NAFLD management. These results were consistently observed across multiple experiments using the MES-SA/Dx5 cell line, with all findings replicated in at least three independent trials. The data suggest that the interplay between these genetic variants and the IFN pathway may represent a novel target for the treatment of NAFLD and related conditions.

We analyzed multiple sequence variants, including arginine 555-to-tryptophan, P407Q, and p.A384D, in hRPTEC cell lines to determine their potential roles in disease pathogenesis. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between these variants and the two diseases.   The association between Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and arginine 555-to-tryptophan is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including functional assays and genetic linkage studies. However, a negative correlation between arginine 555-to-tryptophan and Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia was also observed, suggesting a dual role for this variant. Similarly, a positive correlation between arginine 555-to-tryptophan and A-T was noted, while a negative correlation was found between arginine 555-to-tryptophan and A-T, indicating that the variant may have context-dependent effects.  The sequence variant P407Q showed a strong association with both Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and A-T. However, the relationship between P407Q and Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia was both positive and negative, depending on the genetic background and cellular context. This variant also exhibited a positive correlation with A-T, but a negative correlation with Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, highlighting the complexity of its role in disease.  The variant p.A384D was found to be associated with both Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and A-T. A positive correlation between p.A384D and Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia was observed, while a negative correlation was noted between p.A384D and A-T. Additionally, a negative correlation between p.A384D and Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia was also detected, suggesting that this variant may have opposing effects in different disease contexts.  Overall, our results demonstrate that the hRPTEC cell line serves as a valuable model for studying the genetic and functional relationships between sequence variants and neurodegenerative diseases. The findings underscore the importance of considering both positive and negative correlations when interpreting the role of genetic variants in disease pathogenesis.

36306752|t|L-asparaginase, prostanoids, and MPTP: molecular interactions and their implications in lumbar disc disease, chronic allograft nephropathy, and visual halluc
36306752|a|Recent studies have uncovered complex molecular interactions involving L-asparaginase, prostanoids, and MPTP, with significant implications for the pathogenesis of lumbar disc disease, chronic allograft nephropathy, and visual hallucinations. L-asparaginase has been shown to bind to HGD and annexin V, and its association with FoxP3 and Keratin 12 suggests a role in immune regulation and structural integrity. Additionally, L-asparaginase cotreatments with prostanoids and MPTP have been explored in experimental models, revealing potential therapeutic applications. Prostanoids, in turn, bind to Keratin 12 and associate with annexin V, further linking them to cellular processes involved in tissue repair and inflammation. MPTP exhibits binding interactions with annexin V and Keratin 12, and its cotreatment with prostanoids and L-asparaginase has been associated with altered disease progression in models of chronic allograft nephropathy and visual hallucinations. These findings highlight the intricate network of molecular relationships that may contribute to the development and progression of lumbar disc disease and other phenotypic features such as infertility and IS. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying these interactions and their clinical relevance.

14086103|t|DUCaP cell line and sequence variants in the context of ALD, IL-1beta, Wnt, Spred1, and TRK signaling 
14086103|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, cellular signaling pathways, and disease phenotypes in the DUCaP cell line. This research investigates the role of sequence variants such as 521T>C, 111G, and rs5966709 in modulating the expression and function of key genes like nAchR, IL-1beta, Wnt, Spred1, and TRK. The DUCaP cell line, known for its relevance in neurodegenerative disease models, was used to assess the impact of these genetic variations on cellular responses.   A significant positive correlation was observed between IL-1beta and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting a potential role for this cytokine in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Furthermore, the association between AQP4 and autosomal recessive disorder of galactose metabolism was confirmed through functional assays, indicating a possible involvement of AQP4 in the transport mechanisms affected by this disorder.   The study also demonstrated that nAchR is associated with death in the DUCaP cell line, possibly through its role in apoptosis or neurodegeneration. Additionally, AQP4 was found to bind to TRK, and Wnt was shown to bind to TRK, suggesting that these interactions may be critical in regulating cell survival and differentiation.   Notably, TRK was also associated with ADHD, reinforcing the idea that TRK signaling pathways are implicated in the development of this neurodevelopmental disorder. The DUCaP cell line was also used to examine the effects of the sequence variant Cys 23-Ser 23, which was found to influence the expression of multiple genes, including Wnt and Spred1.   These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases and highlight the importance of genetic variability in shaping cellular responses. The SMMC-7721 cell line was also included as a control to ensure the specificity of the observed effects. Overall, this study underscores the value of integrating genetic, cellular, and functional data to better understand the complex relationships between genes, proteins, and disease phenotypes.

98435471|t|Dengue virus type 2 and Ishikawa cell line interactions: effects of sequence variants, anisomycin, anti-inflammatory drugs, and T allele at -31 on T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma and jo
98435471|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between dengue virus type 2, Ishikawa cell lines, and various genetic and pharmacological factors in the context of T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma and joint pain. The research focuses on the role of the sequence variant 2172_2173insCCCC and its positive correlation with Apamin, as well as the association between the T allele at -31 and joint pain. Additionally, the study explores the positive correlation between anti-inflammatory drugs and Apamin, and the cotreatment of anisomycin with anti-inflammatory drugs.   The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between anti-inflammatory drugs and Apamin, as well as between anti-inflammatory drugs and anisomycin. These results are further supported by the cotreatment of anisomycin and anti-inflammatory drugs, which was observed in multiple experimental conditions. The positive correlation between Apamin and anisomycin was also confirmed through in vitro assays using Ishikawa cell lines.   The T allele at -31 was found to be strongly associated with joint pain, particularly in the context of dengue virus type 2 infection. This association was further reinforced by the positive correlation between the T allele at -31 and anti-inflammatory drugs, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for managing joint pain in affected individuals.   The study also examined the impact of the sequence variant 2172_2173insCCCC on the expression of Apamin in Ishikawa cells, demonstrating a clear positive correlation. Furthermore, the role of yeast in modulating these interactions was explored, with seven instances of yeast being identified as a key factor in the experimental setup.   The results highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and cellular responses in the context of dengue virus type 2 and T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma. The repeated use of Ishikawa and HL-7702 cell lines, along with the multiple instances of dengue virus type 2 and yeast, underscores the comprehensive nature of this investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

64123153|t|CXCL5 dynamics in chick models: interactions with organochloride, EGTA, and Hs578T ce
64123153|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the chemokine CXCL5 and various environmental and cellular factors in chick and Hs578T cell line models. We observed a positive correlation between CXCL5 expression and organochloride levels in chick tissues, suggesting a potential role for organochloride in modulating CXCL5 activity. Conversely, a negative correlation was found between CXCL5 and EGTA in chick-derived cell cultures, indicating that EGTA may inhibit CXCL5 signaling. However, in Hs578T cell lines, a positive correlation between CXCL5 and EGTA was noted, highlighting the context-dependent nature of these interactions. The presence of multiple EGTA molecules in the experimental setup further supported the dual role of EGTA in modulating CXCL5 expression. Additionally, the high frequency of organochloride exposure in chick environments was associated with increased CXCL5 levels, reinforcing the negative correlation between these two entities. The study also revealed that Hs578T cells, when exposed to varying concentrations of EGTA and organochloride, exhibited distinct patterns of CXCL5 expression, underscoring the importance of these chemical entities in cellular responses. These findings provide critical insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing CXCL5 in both chick and human cell line models, with implications for understanding inflammatory and immune responses in the presence of environmental toxins.

37273265|t|Genetic Variants and Phenotypic Associations in Neurological Disorders and Radiation 
37273265|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations of specific sequence variants and their implications in neurological disorders and radiation injury. We focus on the sequence variant T2734C, which shows a positive correlation with glioblastoma and a negative correlation with X-linked intellectual disability. Additionally, T2734C is associated with arginine 714 and p.G204VfsX28, highlighting its role in multiple biological pathways. The sequence variant -134delA is negatively correlated with glioblastoma and radiation injury, suggesting a protective effect against these conditions. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between X-linked intellectual disability and arginine 714, reinforcing the complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic outcomes. The study also examines the cell lines MCF-7, PA-1, CA3, MEF, and MC3T3-E1, which are used to model the effects of these genetic variants in different cellular contexts. The organism taxa rhesus monkeys, Drosophila, Spirulina, Mangifera indica Linn, DEN-2, Toxorynchites mosquitoes, and cats are included to provide a broader understanding of the biological relevance of these associations across species. The findings underscore the importance of genetic variability in disease susceptibility and response to environmental stressors such as radiation.

22967458|t|Capan1 cell line and synaptotagmin interactions in the context of HPVs and sequence variants G12D and g
22967458|a|The Capan1 cell line, a well-characterized model for pancreatic cancer, was used to investigate the functional interactions between synaptotagmin, Wnt signaling, and the sequence variants G12D and g.2839T>G. Our study revealed a significant association between synaptotagmin and Wnt, with Wnt acting as a key mediator in the regulation of synaptotagmin expression. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the sequence variants G12D and g.2839T>G, suggesting a potential genetic linkage between these two variants. The Capan1 cell line was also found to exhibit a notable association between PAK2 and Wnt, as well as between PAK2 and synaptotagmin, indicating a complex regulatory network involving these proteins. Furthermore, the interaction between synaptotagmin and PAK2 was confirmed through multiple experimental approaches, including co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. The presence of HPVs in the Capan1 cell line was associated with altered expression levels of both synaptotagmin and Wnt, highlighting the role of viral infection in modulating these pathways. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between synaptotagmin, Wnt, PAK2, and the sequence variants G12D and g.2839T>G in the context of HPVs and the Capan1 cell line.

77910890|t|DEPTOR and c-Jun N-terminal kinase interactions in diverse cell lines and organisms: implications for gene regulation and immune r
77910890|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between DEPTOR and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) across multiple cell lines and organisms, with a focus on their regulatory roles in cellular signaling and immune responses. Using a combination of biochemical assays and transcriptomic profiling, we observed a positive correlation between JNK and Mad2, suggesting a potential role for JNK in mitotic regulation. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between C2 and Mad2, indicating a possible antagonistic relationship between these two proteins.   The association between C2 and JNK was further supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting a potential functional link between these two gene products. Notably, we also identified a negative correlation between PEMT and CD4, which was corroborated by gene expression analysis in multiple cell lines, including DUCaP and SJ-GBM2. This finding suggests a regulatory relationship between PEMT and the CD4 receptor, possibly influencing immune cell function.  In parallel, we observed a negative correlation between C2 and PEMT, which was further validated by binding assays showing direct interaction between nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and PEMT. This interaction may play a role in the regulation of PEMT activity in response to inflammatory signals. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between FoxP3 and CD4, consistent with the known role of FoxP3 in the regulation of regulatory T cells.   The study also included a detailed analysis of the relationship between FoxP3 and C2, revealing a binding interaction that may contribute to the modulation of immune responses. Our findings were validated across multiple organisms, including horses, tobacco, and zebrafish, as well as in cell lines such as hRPTEC, 293T, and Ishikawa.   In addition to these findings, we examined the expression of the gene product Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 in various cell lines, including LNCaP and SMMC-7721, and found no significant correlation with the other gene products studied. The study also included an analysis of the gene product MAP9 in the context of the organism Rhodiola rosea, suggesting potential applications in plant-based therapeutic strategies.  Overall, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions between DEPTOR, JNK, C2, PEMT, and FoxP3, with implications for both cellular signaling and immune regulation across diverse biological systems.

60921793|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and disease phenotypes in the context of nephrotic syndrome. The research focuses on rabbits and horses, with particular attention to the sequence variant changes asparagine 86 for alanine and eliminates amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline), which is associated with the E359K mutation. The study also examines the effects of sorafenib, AAS, clonidine, and Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides on nephrotic syndrome and their interrelationships.  In rabbits, the sequence variant changes asparagine 86 for alanine and eliminates amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline) is strongly associated with the E359K mutation, suggesting a potential functional link. This variant is also linked to nephrotic syndrome, with a positive correlation observed in both rabbits and horses. The study reveals that nephrotic syndrome is positively correlated with sorafenib, AAS, and clonidine, but negatively correlated with Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides.  Sorafenib exhibits a negative correlation with AAS, clonidine, and Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides, while it shows a positive correlation with nephrotic syndrome. The negative correlation between sorafenib and AAS is further supported by the comparison between these two chemical entities, which highlights their opposing effects on disease progression. Similarly, clonidine is negatively correlated with AAS and sorafenib, and its relationship with Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides is explored through comparative analysis.  The study also compares AAS with Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides, revealing a negative correlation between AAS and Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides. This finding is consistent with the negative correlation between AAS and nephrotic syndrome, which is further reinforced by the positive correlation between nephrotic syndrome and AAS. The comparison between clonidine and Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides suggests a complex interplay, with clonidine showing a negative correlation with these ginsenosides.  In horses, the sequence variant changes asparagine 86 for alanine and eliminates amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline) is associated with nephrotic syndrome, reinforcing the positive correlation between this variant and the disease. The study also highlights the negative correlation between nephrotic syndrome and Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides, suggesting that these ginsenosides may have protective effects against the disease.  Overall, the findings underscore the intricate relationships between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and disease phenotypes in nephrotic syndrome, with implications for therapeutic strategies in rabbits and horses.

16562973|t|Bmp7, modafinil, and L-364,718 interactions in HS-RDEB: a study in cats with sequence variants in NMDA receptor 2A and G
16562973|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the gene Bmp7, the chemical entity modafinil, and the chemical entity L-364,718 in the context of HS-RDEB (Hemorrhagic Septicemia-Related Dermatomyositis in cats). We analyzed a cohort of 40 cats diagnosed with HS-RDEB, all of which exhibited multiple sequence variants, including C111G, Val624-Val625del, c.643T>C, 714C, and G12D. The presence of these variants was associated with varying degrees of disease severity and response to treatment.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between Bmp7 and modafinil, suggesting that modafinil may modulate Bmp7 expression or activity in HS-RDEB. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between modafinil and HS-RDEB, indicating that modafinil may have a therapeutic role in managing the disease. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation was found between L-364,718 and HS-RDEB, suggesting that L-364,718 may be a potential biomarker or therapeutic agent for this condition.   The study also highlights a positive correlation between Bmp7 and L-364,718, indicating a possible synergistic relationship between these two entities in the pathophysiology of HS-RDEB. Moreover, we found positive correlations between NMDA receptor 2A and both L-364,718 and modafinil, suggesting that these three entities may be part of a shared signaling pathway. Similarly, Gg-globin was found to have positive correlations with both L-364,718 and modafinil, further supporting the idea of a complex network of interactions among these molecules in HS-RDEB.   These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HS-RDEB and suggest potential therapeutic strategies involving modafinil, L-364,718, and Bmp7. The study also underscores the importance of sequence variants in modulating these interactions, as multiple variants were found to be associated with the disease phenotype in cats.

09465634|a|This study investigates the multifaceted interactions between the D90A sequence variant and various biological entities, including hyperopia, lamellate thrombi, gynecologic malignancy, and glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), across multiple cell lines and HPVs. The research focuses on the role of the D90A variant in modulating disease phenotypes and cellular responses in the context of guinea pig and human-derived cell lines such as H9c2, GT1-1, HK2, and SW480.   The findings reveal a positive correlation between the D90A variant and hyperopia, lamellate thrombi, and gynecologic malignancy, while simultaneously showing a negative correlation between D90A and hyperopia. These results suggest that the D90A variant may act as a modulator in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Additionally, the study demonstrates a negative correlation between GDNF and both gynecologic malignancy and lamellate thrombi, indicating that GDNF may have a protective role against these diseases.   Interestingly, the relationship between GDNF and hyperopia is complex, with both negative correlations observed between GDNF and hyperopia, as well as between hyperopia and GDNF. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes. The study also emphasizes the importance of HPVs in these interactions, with multiple instances of HPVs being associated with the observed phenotypes.   The results underscore the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations, particularly in the context of different cell lines and organismal models. The data provide a foundation for understanding how genetic variants like D90A and factors such as GDNF influence disease outcomes in diverse biological systems.

32044266|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, neurological disorders, and viral infections. This research investigates the associations between specific sequence variants in the PARK2 gene and several disease phenotypes, including migraines, myelosuppression, and Meningococcal disease, in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV 1/2 infections. The study focuses on the sequence variants c.611delG, c.2444A>C, and p.A384D, which were found to be significantly linked to migraines, myelosuppression, and Meningococcal disease.   The findings reveal a strong association between the sequence variant c.2444A>C and migraines, suggesting a potential role for this variant in the pathogenesis of migraine disorders. Additionally, the variant c.611delG was found to be significantly associated with myelosuppression, indicating its possible involvement in the suppression of hematopoietic function. The variant p.A384D was also linked to myelosuppression, further supporting the hypothesis that multiple sequence variants in PARK2 may contribute to the development of this condition.   Interestingly, the study also identified a negative correlation between PARK2 and Meningococcal disease, suggesting that variations in PARK2 may influence susceptibility to this bacterial infection. Similarly, a negative correlation was observed between PARK2 and migraines, indicating that certain genetic variants in PARK2 may protect against the development of migraines.   The research further explored the role of HBV and HIV 1/2 in modulating these associations. The presence of HBV was found to exacerbate the effects of c.611delG on myelosuppression, while HIV 1/2 infections were associated with increased migraines in individuals carrying the c.2444A>C variant. The study also included the use of HEK cell lines to model the interactions between these genetic variants and viral proteins, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.   Overall, this study underscores the importance of genetic variants in PARK2 in the context of neurological and immunological disorders, and highlights the potential for personalized medicine approaches in managing these conditions. The results also emphasize the need for further research into the interactions between genetic factors and viral infections in the development of complex diseases.

16665966|t|Polyadenylate Binding-Protein Nuclear 1 and IKKalpha/beta: Interactions with Sequence Variants and Chemical Entities in Metabolic Re
16665966|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the gene product polyadenylate binding-protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1), the kinase IKKalpha/beta, and various sequence variants and chemical entities in the context of metabolic regulation. The research highlights the association between the nine nucleotide insertion and free fatty acids, suggesting a potential role in lipid metabolism. Additionally, the cotreatment of free fatty acids with 5 fluorouracil and emodin was explored, revealing synergistic effects in modulating metabolic pathways.   A positive correlation was observed between PABPN1 and free fatty acids, indicating a possible regulatory role of PABPN1 in lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between PABPN1 and emodin, suggesting that emodin may influence PABPN1 expression or activity. The association between G51S and 5 fluorouracil was confirmed, although a negative correlation between G51S and emodin was also noted, indicating potential antagonistic interactions.   The Gln/Gln variant showed an association with both free fatty acids and emodin, suggesting a dual role in metabolic processes. A negative correlation between the nine nucleotide insertion and emodin was identified, while the nine nucleotide insertion was also associated with 5 fluorouracil. The 8-bp nucleotide (TTAAATGG) deletion was found to be negatively correlated with free fatty acids and associated with 5 fluorouracil, highlighting its potential impact on metabolic pathways.   The cotreatment of 5 fluorouracil and emodin was examined, revealing a synergistic effect in modulating metabolic responses. The study also confirmed the association between G51S and free fatty acids, reinforcing the complex interplay between genetic variants and metabolic regulators. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic regulation and the potential therapeutic implications of these interactions.

91000712|t|Genetic Variants and Gene Expression in Zebrafish, Guinea Pigs, and Mangifera indica Linn: A Multispecies Analysis of Cidec, InsR, and Sequence 
91000712|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional relationships between sequence variants and gene expression in multiple species, including zebrafish, guinea pigs, and Mangifera indica Linn. We focus on the associations between the sequence variants del(1)(p31.2p32.3), C-1228T, 1359 G/A, and c.695T>A, and their interactions with the gene products Cidec and InsR. The study also explores the role of these genetic elements in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and E. coli infections, as well as in C. elegans and sheep models.   Our findings reveal a complex network of associations among the sequence variants. Specifically, C-1228T is positively correlated with 1359 G/A and c.695T>A, while 1359 G/A is associated with both C-1228T and c.695T>A. Additionally, del(1)(p31.2p32.3) is linked to C-1228T, 1359 G/A, and c.695T>A, with mutual associations between del(1)(p31.2p32.3) and c.695T>A. These associations suggest a potential regulatory or functional interplay among these variants.   In terms of gene expression, we observe a positive correlation between Cidec and InsR, indicating a possible functional relationship between these gene products. This correlation is further supported by the presence of multiple instances of Cidec and InsR in the study, highlighting their importance in the genetic architecture of the organisms examined.   The study also includes data from E. coli and C. elegans, which provide insights into the broader implications of these genetic variants across different biological systems. The inclusion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mangifera indica Linn adds a layer of complexity, as these organisms may serve as models for understanding the functional consequences of genetic variation in diverse contexts.   Overall, this research underscores the intricate relationships between genetic variants and gene expression, offering a foundation for further studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations in both model and non-model organisms.

44486906|t|Genetic Variants and Functional Associations in Daucus carota, Patients, and Horses: Implications for Copper/Zinc Superoxide Dismutase, WFS1, and IL-21 
44486906|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic associations between various sequence variants, gene products, and cell lines in Daucus carota, patients, and horses. We focus on the roles of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, WFS1, and IL-21 in modulating cellular responses to chemical entities such as picrotoxin and ifosfamide. The study includes multiple cell lines, including CA3, MH134, and IEC-6, to assess the impact of genetic variability on biological processes.   Key findings include the association between p.Val204Asp and the PGA2 receptor, as well as between p.Val204Asp and IL-21. These associations are further supported by the interaction between IL-21 and the PGA2 receptor. The D allele for the -1607 variant is also linked to the PGA2 receptor, highlighting its potential role in modulating receptor function. Additionally, the C61G variant is associated with IL-21, and the WFS1 gene product is functionally connected to IL-21.   The cytosine insertion is found to be associated with both copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and IL-21, suggesting a broader regulatory role in these pathways. The nine nucleotide insertion is linked to the PGA2 receptor, while the deletion of 6 bp at position 1494 is associated with copper/zinc superoxide dismutase. The sequence variant rs4828037 is also found to be associated with the PGA2 receptor, reinforcing the complex interplay between genetic variants and gene products.   The study further explores the role of the p.Val204Asp variant in modulating the activity of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, and the C61G variant is shown to influence IL-21 expression. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between genetic variants, gene products, and cellular responses in diverse organisms, including Daucus carota, patients, and horses.

20325285|t|Genetic variants in Lyl1 and MCT1 modulate hyperalgesia and IL-17 expression in women 
20325285|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional relationships between the sequence variant p.V239del, the genes Lyl1 and MCT1, and the phenotypic feature hyperalgesia in both women and dogs. We focus on the association between p.V239del and Lyl1, which was found to be significantly correlated in both species. Additionally, we observed a strong association between Lyl1 and MCT1, with a negative correlation between Lyl1 and IL-17 in women. The sequence variant p.V239del showed a positive correlation with hyperalgesia in both women and dogs, and a negative correlation with MCT1 in women. Furthermore, hyperalgesia was found to be negatively correlated with Lyl1 in women, but positively correlated with MCT1 in dogs. The gene IL-17 was found to be associated with Lyl1, with a negative correlation between IL-17 and MCT1 in women. The study also revealed that the sequence variant p.V239del is associated with hyperalgesia in both species, and that MCT1 is associated with hyperalgesia in dogs. These findings suggest a complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic features in the context of pain perception and immune response. The results were validated using hRPTEC cell lines derived from both women and dogs, and the data were consistent across multiple experimental conditions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia and immune-related gene expression in different species.

20250171|t|Spirulina and its interactions with Metallothionein, glucose, and calcineurin inhibitors in immune ce
20250171|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between Spirulina, Metallothionein, glucose, and calcineurin inhibitors in the context of immune cell function. Using the Ba/F3 and RAW 264.7 cell lines, we explored how these factors influence each other and their biological outcomes. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between bombesin and Metallothionein, suggesting that increased levels of bombesin may suppress Metallothionein expression. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between calcineurin inhibitors and bombesin, indicating that calcineurin inhibitors may enhance bombesin activity.   A negative correlation was also found between glucose and calcineurin inhibitors, implying that glucose may inhibit the effects of calcineurin inhibitors. In contrast, a positive correlation was noted between glucose and Histamine, as well as between Histamine and glucose, highlighting a potential regulatory role of glucose in Histamine metabolism. Additionally, an association was found between Metallothionein and glucose, suggesting that glucose may modulate Metallothionein expression.   The study also compared glucose and Metallothionein, revealing a positive correlation that supports their potential interdependence. A negative correlation was observed between Histamine and Metallothionein, indicating that these two molecules may act in opposition under certain conditions. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between calcineurin inhibitors and Histamine, which contrasts with the earlier negative correlation between calcineurin inhibitors and Histamine, suggesting a complex regulatory network.   The association between calcineurin inhibitors and Metallothionein was also confirmed, indicating a potential functional link between these two molecules. A comparison between calcineurin inhibitors and glucose revealed an association, reinforcing the idea that glucose may influence calcineurin inhibitor activity. Finally, a positive correlation was observed between glucose and calcineurin inhibitors, which aligns with the negative correlation between calcineurin inhibitors and bombesin, suggesting a dynamic interplay among these factors.   These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between Spirulina, Metallothionein, glucose, and calcineurin inhibitors in immune cell lines, with implications for understanding their roles in cellular signaling and immune responses.

31054275|t|Buprenorphine, Antibiotic Interactions, and Genetic Variants in Polyuria and Related Ph
31054275|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between buprenorphine, antibiotic use, and genetic sequence variants in the context of polyuria and related phenotypes. Buprenorphine, a chemical entity widely used in opioid therapy, was found to have a positive correlation with the sequence variant D299G and a strong association with polyuria. Additionally, buprenorphine showed a positive correlation with the 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182, which was itself associated with polyuria. The conversion between buprenorphine and antibiotic was observed, with antibiotic use showing a positive correlation with both D299G and polyuria.   The sequence variant Cys 23-Ser 23 was found to be associated with polyuria and also with antibiotic use. Furthermore, Cys 23-Ser 23 exhibited a positive correlation with antibiotic and a direct association with D299G. The 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 was associated with both buprenorphine and Cys 23-Ser 23, and it also showed a positive correlation with antibiotic. The cotreatment of buprenorphine and antibiotic was linked to increased polyuria, and the association between antibiotic and the 105-bp deletion was further reinforced by its positive correlation with polyuria.   The study also revealed that the sequence variant D299G was associated with buprenorphine and had a positive correlation with both antibiotic and buprenorphine. The 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 was found to have a direct association with D299G, and the sequence variant Cys 23-Ser 23 was associated with both buprenorphine and D299G. These findings highlight the intricate relationships between chemical entities, genetic variants, and phenotypic features such as polyuria, underscoring the need for further research into their clinical implications.

89424504|t|Genetic and functional analysis of Bmi1, DBH, and IL-2 in 253JB-V cells derived from Mangifera ind
89424504|a|In this study, we investigated the genetic and functional relationships between the gene products Bmi1, DBH, and IL-2 in the context of the 253JB-V cell line, which was isolated from Mangifera indica Linn. Our findings reveal a complex network of interactions among these genes and their sequence variants.   We observed a negative correlation between Bmi1 and IL-2, as well as between Bmi1 and DBH, while a positive correlation was noted between DBH and IL-2. These correlations were further supported by the association of the sequence variant c.689C>G with DBH, and the variant G246X with both c.689C>G and DBH. Additionally, the variant P163S was found to be associated with IL-2, DBH, and c.689C>G, and also linked to G246X.   The sequence variant G246X was found to be associated with multiple other variants, including c.689C>G and P163S, highlighting its central role in the genetic network. Furthermore, the variant P163S was associated with IL-2, reinforcing the interplay between these genes.   Our results suggest that the 253JB-V cell line from Mangifera indica Linn serves as a valuable model for studying the functional and genetic interactions of Bmi1, DBH, and IL-2, as well as their sequence variants. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these gene interactions in this unique cell line.

77071186|t|SJ-GBM2 cell line and the role of Ca(2+) channel blockers in hepatocellular carcinomas: a bacterial per
77071186|a|The SJ-GBM2 cell line, a well-characterized model for studying tumor biology, was used to investigate the relationship between Ca(2+) channel blockers and hepatocellular carcinomas. Our findings suggest a negative correlation between the presence of Ca(2+) channel blockers and the progression of hepatocellular carcinomas in this cell line. This effect was further supported by in vitro experiments where the addition of Ca(2+) channel blockers led to a significant reduction in the proliferation of SJ-GBM2 cells.   To explore the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interaction between Ca(2+) channel blockers and the bacterial microbiome, as bacteria are known to influence tumor development. The study included multiple bacterial strains, and the results indicated that certain bacteria may modulate the efficacy of Ca(2+) channel blockers in suppressing hepatocellular carcinomas.   Further analysis revealed that the presence of specific bacterial taxa correlated with a diminished response to Ca(2+) channel blockers in the SJ-GBM2 cell line. This suggests that the interplay between bacteria, Ca(2+) channel blockers, and hepatocellular carcinomas is complex and may involve microbial modulation of cellular signaling pathways. These findings highlight the importance of considering bacterial influences when evaluating the therapeutic potential of Ca(2+) channel blockers in hepatocellular carcinomas.

49366684|t|FAM161A and Aniridia: genetic and functional links with memory impairment and thiamine metabolism in LbetaT2 and H446 ce
49366684|a|Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of FAM161A in the pathogenesis of Aniridia, a rare congenital disorder characterized by the absence of the iris. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between FAM161A and Aniridia, as well as its potential involvement in memory impairment. Using a combination of genetic and functional assays, we demonstrate a positive correlation between FAM161A expression and Aniridia, as well as between FAM161A and memory impairment. These findings are supported by the presence of multiple sequence variants, including c.263C>T and c.609+28_610-16del, which are associated with altered FAM161A function.   To further explore the functional implications, we examined the effects of thiamine and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium on FAM161A expression in LbetaT2 and H446 cell lines. Our results show that thiamine treatment significantly modulates FAM161A activity, suggesting a potential role for thiamine in the regulation of this gene. Additionally, the presence of 8 nucleotide deletion variants in these cell lines correlates with changes in FAM161A expression levels. These findings provide new insights into the genetic and metabolic pathways linking FAM161A to Aniridia and memory impairment, and suggest that thiamine may serve as a therapeutic target in the management of these conditions.

26829993|t|miR-494 and GFC: interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs, precancerous conditions, and their associations with EH and rectal
26829993|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between microRNAs, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in the context of cancer progression and metabolic disorders. This study investigates the regulatory roles of miR-494 and the chemical entity GFC in the context of precancerous conditions, EH, and rectal cancers. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between miR-494 and precancerous states, suggesting that miR-494 may act as a tumor suppressor in early stages of carcinogenesis. Additionally, miR-494 exhibits a negative correlation with rectal cancers, reinforcing its potential as a biomarker for colorectal malignancies.   The chemical entity GFC is found to bind to miR-494, indicating a direct regulatory interaction that may influence gene expression patterns in cancer-related pathways. Furthermore, the antiarrhythmic drug is shown to bind to miR-494, suggesting a possible pharmacological modulation of miR-494 activity in cardiovascular and oncological contexts.   In parallel, the gene product very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase is found to have a negative correlation with both EH and rectal cancers, implying a protective role against these conditions. Notably, this gene product also shows a negative correlation with alendronate, a bisphosphonate used in the treatment of osteoporosis, suggesting potential interactions between metabolic and oncological pathways.   The study also demonstrates that miR-494 is significantly associated with multiple disease states, including breast cancer and rectal cancers, with a strong negative correlation observed in both cases. These findings underscore the importance of miR-494 in the regulation of disease progression and highlight the need for further research into its therapeutic potential in cancer and metabolic disorders.

31121900|a|Phloridzin exhibits a complex interplay with multiple molecular targets, including the P2RX7 receptor, the sequence variant Delta695-725, and the enzyme N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase, across diverse biological contexts. In PA-1 and Capan1 cell lines, phloridzin shows a positive correlation with P2RX7 expression and activity, suggesting a potential role in modulating purinergic signaling pathways. Additionally, phloridzin is associated with the sequence variant Delta695-725, which may influence protein structure and function in Escherichia coli and other bacterial systems.   A notable positive correlation between phloridzin and N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase was observed in both PA-1 and Capan1 cell lines, indicating a possible regulatory relationship between the compound and glycosylation processes. This interaction is further supported by the negative correlation between phloridzin and coronary artery disease, as well as the negative correlation between phloridzin and viral infection, suggesting that phloridzin may have protective effects against these conditions.   In the context of HIV-1 and tobacco-related pathologies, phloridzin's interactions with P2RX7 and N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase may contribute to its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. The consistent presence of phloridzin across multiple cell lines and organisms highlights its broad biological relevance. These findings underscore the potential of phloridzin as a therapeutic agent in the management of coronary artery disease and viral infections, with further research needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its effects.

01856672|a|This study explores the complex interactions between the gene FBXL7, the enzyme NADPH oxidases, and various sequence variants in the context of congenital panocular disorder and urolithiasis. Using rabbit cell lines 253JB-V and SNU-C2A, we investigate how these genetic and molecular elements interact with tritium, neopterin, and NH3. The findings reveal a significant association between congenital panocular disorder and neopterin, as well as between JBTS and NH3. Additionally, the sequence variant Arg124Cys is found to be associated with neopterin, while the AG-dinucleotide variant shows a strong association with neopterin as well.   The study also demonstrates a direct bind between neopterin and FBXL7, and between tritium and FBXL7, suggesting a potential role for these interactions in the pathogenesis of congenital panocular disorder. Furthermore, the enzyme NADPH oxidases is associated with both FBXL7 and tritium, indicating a possible regulatory or functional link. The drug interaction between neopterin and tritium is also observed, as is the drug interaction between NH3 and tritium.   Notably, the association between JBTS and tritium, as well as between JBTS and neopterin, highlights the potential involvement of these elements in the development of urolithiasis. The study also identifies a significant association between Arg124Cys and NH3, further emphasizing the complex interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying congenital panocular disorder and related phenotypic features in rabbit models.

52922192|t|Genetic Variants in Platonia insignis Mart and DEN-4: Associations with Liver Failure, GI AEs, and Retino
52922192|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants and disease outcomes in Platonia insignis Mart and DEN-4. We analyzed the impact of multiple sequence variants, including histidine 626-to-arginine, Lys198Asn, and c.1092 +1G>A, on the occurrence of liver failure, GI AEs, alopecia, and Retinoblastoma. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between histidine 626-to-arginine and GI AEs, as well as between histidine 626-to-arginine and Retinoblastoma. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between histidine 626-to-arginine and alopecia. The sequence variant del(1)(p31.2p32.3) showed a negative correlation with liver failure, and it was also associated with c.1092 +1G>A. Furthermore, Lys198Asn was found to be associated with del(1)(p31.2p32.3). The study also included multiple instances of liver failure, alopecia, and GI AEs, with the latter being particularly prevalent in DEN-4. The organism Platonia insignis Mart was found to be associated with several of these genetic variants, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. These results highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes in both Platonia insignis Mart and DEN-4, with implications for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.

34132125|t|Toxorynchites mosquitoes and hyperventilation: genetic and pharmacological insights into the role of -511C/T and ba
34132125|a|Toxorynchites mosquitoes have been implicated in the transmission of various diseases, and recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between their physiological responses and environmental factors. This study investigates the relationship between hyperventilation, a phenotypic feature observed in Toxorynchites mosquitoes under stress conditions, and two key genetic and pharmacological factors: the sequence variant -511C/T and the chemical entity batimastat.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between hyperventilation and the -511C/T sequence variant in Toxorynchites mosquitoes, suggesting that this genetic polymorphism may influence respiratory behavior under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate an association between hyperventilation and batimastat, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, indicating that batimastat may modulate respiratory responses in these mosquitoes.   The study involved a controlled experimental setup where Toxorynchites mosquitoes were exposed to varying levels of hypoxia and treated with batimastat. The results showed that mosquitoes carrying the -511C/T variant exhibited increased hyperventilation rates compared to those with the wild-type allele. Furthermore, the administration of batimastat was associated with a significant reduction in hyperventilation, suggesting a potential pharmacological intervention for managing respiratory responses in these mosquitoes.   These findings provide new insights into the genetic and pharmacological mechanisms underlying hyperventilation in Toxorynchites mosquitoes and may have implications for understanding the physiological adaptations of mosquitoes to environmental stressors. The study also underscores the importance of considering both genetic and chemical factors in the study of mosquito behavior and disease transmission.

30182805|t|Genetic variants in MPO and miR-31 modulate hepatic fibrogenesis and developmental anomalies in HeLa ce
30182805|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between genetic variants and the development of cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, as well as hepatic fibrogenesis. Using HeLa cell lines, we explored the functional impact of several sequence variants and their interactions with key genes and microRNAs. The variant 735-6 TG>AT was found to be significantly associated with cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, suggesting a role in developmental pathways. Additionally, this variant was shown to influence the expression of miR-31, a microRNA known to regulate multiple cellular processes.   The sequence variant c.2380 +1G>A was strongly associated with the gene MPO, which encodes myeloperoxidase, a critical enzyme in immune response and inflammation. Functional assays in HeLa cells demonstrated that this variant alters splicing patterns and protein expression, potentially contributing to disease susceptibility.   Hepatic fibrogenesis was linked to both rs5966709 and 735-6 TG>AT. The variant rs5966709 was found to modulate the expression of genes involved in fibrotic pathways, while 735-6 TG>AT was shown to interact with miR-31, which in turn affects the regulation of fibrogenic processes. Furthermore, the insertion of (GCG)4GCA was observed to co-occur with multiple variants, suggesting a potential synergistic effect on disease progression.   The gene product RagA-D was also implicated in the pathogenesis of these conditions, with its expression levels being influenced by the studied variants. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants, gene expression, and disease phenotypes, providing new insights into the molecular basis of cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, as well as hepatic fibrogenesis.

64374120|t|ATM/ATR kinases and E-cadherin: interactions with tarsal fusion, HIV infection, and bipolar and unipolar disorder in rDEN-2 and Toxorynchites mo
64374120|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between ATM/ATR kinases, E-cadherin, tarsal fusion, and bipolar and unipolar disorder in the context of rDEN-2 and Toxorynchites mosquitoes. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between ATM/ATR kinases and HIV infection, suggesting a potential role for these kinases in the pathogenesis of HIV. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between ATM/ATR kinases and bipolar and unipolar disorder, indicating a possible involvement in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these conditions.   The association between E-cadherin and bipolar and unipolar disorder is further supported by our data, highlighting the importance of cell adhesion molecules in psychiatric disorders. We also find a positive correlation between tarsal fusion and ATM/ATR kinases, which may have implications for developmental biology in rDEN-2.   Notably, there is a positive correlation between tarsal fusion and Bad, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship between these two factors. Our results also demonstrate an association between Bad and ATM/ATR kinases, as well as a positive correlation between HIV infection and Bad. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between RA and Bad, and a positive correlation between RA and E-cadherin, indicating overlapping pathways in inflammatory and psychiatric conditions.  A negative correlation between ATM/ATR kinases and Bad is also reported, suggesting a complex regulatory network. Additionally, we find a bind between Bad and heme oxygenase-1, which may have implications for oxidative stress and disease progression. Finally, a positive correlation between E-cadherin and HIV infection is noted, reinforcing the role of cell adhesion molecules in immune responses. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions and their interrelationships in both human and mosquito models.

97454426|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of rs7535263, morphine, and thyroxine in the context of Diffuse mesangial s
97454426|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between the genetic variant rs7535263, the opioid morphine, and the thyroid hormone thyroxine in the context of Diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS). Our findings reveal a positive correlation between morphine and DMS, suggesting that morphine exposure may exacerbate the progression of this renal disease. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between thyroxine and morphine, indicating that thyroxine may mitigate the effects of morphine in this context.   The genetic variant rs7535263 was found to be positively correlated with morphine, implying a potential role in modulating morphine's pharmacological effects. However, rs7535263 also exhibited a negative correlation with thyroxine, suggesting a possible antagonistic relationship between these two chemical entities. Furthermore, rs7535263 was associated with morphine, reinforcing its potential as a genetic marker for morphine response.   Interestingly, the relationship between DMS and morphine was both positive and negative, highlighting the complexity of the disease-morphine interaction. Similarly, the relationship between DMS and thyroxine was negative, suggesting that thyroxine may have a protective effect against the development of DMS.   These findings underscore the importance of considering genetic and pharmacological interactions in the management of DMS and related conditions. The multiple correlations observed between rs7535263, morphine, and thyroxine provide a foundation for future research into personalized treatment strategies for patients with DMS.

04344717|t|Msx1, Bicaudal D2, and MAP9: Interactions with sequence variants and lovastatin in the context of catechol neurotransmitter re
04344717|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between the gene products Msx1, Bicaudal D2, and MAP9, and various sequence variants, including the 5 nucleotide deletion, rs1441817, guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA), M 235, and p.G821S. These interactions are further modulated by the chemical entity lovastatin and the biological activity of catechol neurotransmitters. A positive correlation was observed between lovastatin and M 235, as well as between lovastatin and rs1441817, suggesting a potential pharmacological synergy. Similarly, a positive correlation was found between lovastatin and p.G821S, reinforcing the role of lovastatin in modulating genetic variants.   The association between MAP9 and lovastatin, along with the positive correlation between MAP9 and catechol neurotransmitters, highlights the role of MAP9 in mediating the effects of both pharmacological and neurochemical agents. Additionally, the positive correlation between catechol neurotransmitters and guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA) suggests a potential mechanism by which sequence variants influence neurotransmitter activity. The cotreatment of lovastatin and catechol neurotransmitters was found to enhance their individual effects, indicating a possible therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative conditions.  Msx1 was found to bind to both Bicaudal D2 and MAP9, forming a functional network that may regulate gene expression and cellular signaling. The association between Msx1 and lovastatin, as well as between Msx1 and catechol neurotransmitters, further supports the role of Msx1 in integrating genetic and pharmacological signals. The positive correlation between catechol neurotransmitters and 5 nucleotide deletion, along with the positive correlation between catechol neurotransmitters and M 235, underscores the importance of these sequence variants in modulating neurotransmitter function.  The bind between Bicaudal D2 and Msx1, as well as between Bicaudal D2 and MAP9, suggests a coordinated regulatory mechanism involving these gene products. The positive correlation between rs1441817 and catechol neurotransmitters, and between p.G821S and catechol neurotransmitters, further supports the idea that sequence variants can influence neurotransmitter activity. Overall, these findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and neurochemical signals in the context of disease pathogenesis.

30878785|t|Genetic Variants in THRA and Their Associations with Sequence Variants and Cell Line Models in Dogs, Rabbits, and Rhesus
30878785|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic associations between several sequence variants and the gene THRA across multiple species, including dogs, rabbits, and rhesus monkeys. The sequence variants Val624-Val625del, AFF344-345ins, and rs1329428 were analyzed in relation to the gene THRA and to each other, with particular emphasis on their roles in cellular processes. The findings reveal a complex network of interactions, including the association between rs1329428 and THRA, and between AFF344-345ins and THRA. Additionally, Val624-Val625del is found to be associated with both AFF344-345ins and rs1329428, highlighting potential genetic linkage between these variants. These associations were further validated using cell lines such as C57BL/6 and Ishikawa, which are commonly used in genetic and molecular studies. The study also includes data from guinea pigs and rhesus monkeys, demonstrating the broad relevance of these genetic variants across different species. The results suggest that these sequence variants may play a significant role in the regulation of THRA and could be important in understanding the genetic basis of certain phenotypes in these organisms. The findings provide a foundation for further research into the functional implications of these genetic variants in both basic and translational biomedical contexts.

26918857|t|The mToR Pathway and Its Interactions with Genetic Variants in Neurodevelopmental Disorders an
26918857|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the mToR pathway and genetic variants in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. The mToR gene product was found to be significantly associated with androgen and estrogen levels, suggesting a potential role in hormonal regulation. However, mToR was also negatively correlated with hypothermia and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, indicating possible inhibitory effects on these conditions.   The sequence variant D299G showed a negative correlation with antibiotic and androgen levels, as well as with Dopamine and estrogen, suggesting that this variant may interfere with the normal function of mToR and other related pathways. Additionally, D299G was negatively correlated with paroxetine, which may have implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.   The sequence variant +8365 C/T was found to be negatively correlated with paroxetine and Dopamine, and also with androgen, indicating a potential role in modulating drug response and neurochemical balance. The rs5393 variant was also negatively correlated with paroxetine, further supporting the idea that genetic variability in these regions may influence drug metabolism and efficacy.  In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, the study found that mToR was negatively correlated with Senior-Loken syndrome and cleft palate, suggesting a possible involvement in developmental processes. The presence of hypothermia was also negatively correlated with mToR, which may point to a regulatory role in thermoregulation.   The chemical entity vinblastine was associated with mToR, highlighting potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment. Dopamine and estrogen were found to have complex interactions with mToR, with both showing negative correlations, which may have implications for neurodegenerative and endocrine disorders.   Overall, the study provides evidence for the multifaceted role of mToR in both physiological and pathological processes, as well as the importance of genetic variants in modulating these interactions. These findings may have significant implications for personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies.

05070404|t|KCl and diltiazem interactions in the context of b-Catenin and resting tremor: a comparative and mechanist
05070404|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between KCl, diltiazem, and b-Catenin in the context of resting tremor and their potential implications for therapeutic strategies. We demonstrate that KCl binds to insulin, suggesting a possible role in modulating insulin signaling pathways. Additionally, we find that diltiazem exhibits a significant association with b-Catenin, indicating a potential mechanism by which diltiazem may influence cellular adhesion and signaling.   Our findings also reveal that diltiazem interacts with dihydrofolate, highlighting a possible pharmacological synergy or antagonism in the treatment of certain neurological conditions. Furthermore, we compare the effects of bort and dihydrofolate, noting that bort exhibits a distinct pharmacological profile compared to dihydrofolate. Notably, bort shows a drug interaction with Arsenic, which may have implications for its use in combination therapies.   We also compare bort and diltiazem, finding that their mechanisms of action differ significantly, with bort showing a unique interaction with KCl. Additionally, we observe that KCl and diltiazem exhibit a comparative relationship, with diltiazem showing a stronger association with b-Catenin. These findings suggest that the interplay between these chemical entities and their interactions with genetic and phenotypic factors may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of resting tremor and related conditions. The results provide a foundation for further research into the therapeutic potential of these compounds in neurological disorders.

72427701|t|CSF-1R and TBX1 interactions in Aedes mosquitoes: genetic and pharmacological implications of c.689C>G and Na+/K
72427701|a|This study investigates the molecular and pharmacological interactions between the CSF-1R gene, TBX1 gene, and the sequence variant c.689C>G in Aedes mosquitoes, with a focus on their associations with Na+/K+ ATPase and clozapine. We demonstrate a positive correlation between c.689C>G and Na+/K+ ATPase, as well as between c.689C>G and clozapine, suggesting a potential genetic and pharmacological link. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between clozapine and Na+/K+ ATPase, indicating a drug interaction that may influence cellular function. The association between Cidec and CSF-1R is further supported by our findings, highlighting a potential regulatory pathway. In parallel, we find a positive correlation between CSF-1R and Na+/K+ ATPase, reinforcing the role of CSF-1R in modulating this critical ion pump. The association between TBX1 and Cidec is also established, suggesting a coordinated genetic network. Our results are further validated in Mouse models, where the sequence variant c.689C>G is consistently linked to clozapine and Na+/K+ ATPase. Notably, the cell line KU7 exhibits altered expression patterns of Na+/K+ ATPase in response to clozapine, providing in vitro evidence for the drug interaction. Spirulina is used as a model organism to explore the broader implications of these interactions in non-mammalian systems. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic and pharmacological relationships among these key molecular entities in Aedes mosquitoes and other organisms.

22994622|t|Genetic Variants and Their Associations with Breast-Ovarian Cancer: A Comprehensive Analysis of G/C, rs6235, and H
22994622|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants and the risk of breast-ovarian cancer. This research investigates the associations between the sequence variants G/C, rs6235, and His626Arg with the disease phenotype of breast-ovarian cancer. The findings reveal a positive correlation between breast-ovarian cancer and the G/C sequence variant, as well as between breast-ovarian cancer and rs6235. Additionally, a significant association is observed between breast-ovarian cancer and the His626Arg variant, with a positive correlation noted.   The study also demonstrates a negative correlation between breast-ovarian cancer and the gene products TGF-beta1 and -beta2, suggesting a potential protective role of these proteins in the context of this disease. Multiple instances of the G/C sequence variant are found to be associated with breast-ovarian cancer, reinforcing its role as a risk factor. The rs6235 variant is consistently linked to the disease, with evidence supporting its involvement in the pathogenesis of breast-ovarian cancer.   Furthermore, the His626Arg variant is shown to have a positive correlation with breast-ovarian cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease susceptibility. The data suggest that the interplay between these genetic variants and the TGF-beta1 and -beta2 signaling pathways may contribute to the development of breast-ovarian cancer. These findings provide a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex disease and may inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

98889133|t|Actinic keratosis and chronic periodontitis: interactions with DEN-4, E. coli, mouse mammary tumor virus, West Nile virus, and HIV-1 in IEC-6 and CA3 ce
98889133|a|Actinic keratosis and chronic periodontitis are increasingly recognized as complex conditions influenced by multiple environmental and genetic factors. This study investigates the interplay between these two phenotypic features and several pathogens, including DEN-4, E. coli, mouse mammary tumor virus, West Nile virus, and HIV-1, in the context of cellular responses in IEC-6 and CA3 cell lines. The research highlights the role of actinic keratosis in modulating immune responses to DEN-4 and E. coli, while chronic periodontitis is shown to exacerbate the effects of mouse mammary tumor virus and West Nile virus. Additionally, the study explores the impact of HIV-1 on the progression of hypotonia and blindness in patients with actinic keratosis. The findings suggest that the CA3 cell line may serve as a valuable model for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between actinic keratosis and chronic periodontitis. Furthermore, the IEC-6 cell line is found to be particularly responsive to the effects of E. coli and HIV-1, with implications for the development of targeted therapies. The results also emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between these diseases and pathogens in the context of gastric lymphoma and other related conditions. This work provides a comprehensive framework for future studies on the complex relationships between actinic keratosis, chronic periodontitis, and their interactions with various organisms and cell lines.

37828299|t|Sequence variant p.G204_K247del and -120-bp duplication in gliomas: interactions with histamine, Eslicarbazepine acetate, and enhanced green fluorescent protein in SNU-C2A and LbetaT2 ce
37828299|a|This study investigates the molecular and functional interactions between the sequence variant p.G204_K247del, the -120-bp duplication, histamine, Eslicarbazepine acetate, and enhanced green fluorescent protein in the context of gliomas. The research focuses on the SNU-C2A and LbetaT2 cell lines, which are frequently used to model glioma biology.   The findings reveal a negative correlation between histamine and gliomas, suggesting that histamine may act as a suppressor of glioma progression. Conversely, a positive correlation is observed between histamine and the sequence variant p.G204_K247del, indicating that this variant may enhance histamine signaling. Additionally, histamine is associated with the -120-bp duplication, which is further linked to gliomas, suggesting a potential pathway through which histamine influences glioma development.  The study also demonstrates a positive correlation between enhanced green fluorescent protein and the -120-bp duplication, implying that the duplication may promote the expression or activity of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Furthermore, Eslicarbazepine acetate shows a positive correlation with enhanced green fluorescent protein, suggesting a possible synergistic effect in cellular processes.   Drug interaction analyses reveal that histamine interacts with both enhanced green fluorescent protein and Eslicarbazepine acetate, indicating potential pharmacological implications. Notably, the sequence variant p.G204_K247del exhibits a negative correlation with both histamine and enhanced green fluorescent protein, suggesting that this variant may disrupt the signaling pathways involving these molecules.   These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma progression and highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and cellular processes in cancer biology. The use of SNU-C2A and LbetaT2 cell lines allows for a more detailed understanding of these interactions in a controlled experimental setting.

06436237|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the contrast agent iopamidol and various genetic sequence variants across multiple cell lines and organisms. The research focuses on the PC-3, SUM159PT, and HEK cell lines, which were used to model the effects of iopamidol on cellular responses. The study also includes the organism taxons of chick, Human, HPV, and horses, with a particular emphasis on the genetic variability associated with these species.   A key finding is the positive correlation between the sequence variant p.G196S and iopamidol, which was observed in both PC-3 and SUM159PT cell lines. This correlation was further supported by the positive association between p.G196S and steroid, indicating a potential pathway through which iopamidol may influence steroid metabolism. Additionally, the sequence variant rs2234671 showed a positive correlation with steroid, suggesting a possible genetic link between steroid regulation and the presence of this variant.   The sequence variant rs2073416 was found to have a positive correlation with iopamidol, reinforcing the idea that multiple genetic factors may modulate the pharmacological effects of iopamidol. Furthermore, the study demonstrated a conversion between iopamidol and steroid, highlighting the potential for iopamidol to act as a precursor or modulator of steroid pathways.   The sequence variants Q126R and rs2234671 were also found to have positive correlations with both iopamidol and steroid, suggesting a broader network of genetic interactions that influence the pharmacological and metabolic effects of these compounds. The study also included the sequence variants G7958A, 35 delG, and rs2073416, with the latter appearing 10 times, indicating its significant role in the observed interactions.   Overall, the findings suggest that the interplay between genetic sequence variants and the chemical entity iopamidol is complex and may vary across different cell lines and organisms. These results provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and their implications for drug development and personalized medicine.

76330830|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between various chemical entities and their effects on cellular models, with a focus on drug interactions and their potential implications in disease states. Using COS-7, 293T, and HeLa cell lines, we examined the interactions between taxol and acitretin, acitretin and daunorubicin, daunorubicin and acitretin, mangiferin and Zolmitriptan, 6-OHDA and bromocriptine, bromocriptine and Zolmitriptan, 6-OHDA and morphine, Zolmitriptan and daunorubicin, daunorubicin and Zolmitriptan, and daunorubicin and taxol. These interactions were assessed in the context of cellular responses and their potential relevance to sudden death and enzymatic complex I-deficient conditions.   The study also included experiments using rat and rabbit models to evaluate the physiological effects of these drug interactions. Additionally, we explored the impact of 6-OHDA and morphine on rat models of sudden death, while examining the role of bromocriptine in modulating Zolmitriptan's effects. The interactions between daunorubicin and taxol were further analyzed in the context of their potential to induce cellular stress and apoptosis in COS-7 and 293T cell lines.   To provide a broader perspective, we also included studies on Toxorynchites mosquitoes, Aedes mosquitoes, and DEN-4 virus to assess the potential cross-species effects of these chemical entities. The findings suggest that certain drug combinations may have significant implications for both cellular function and disease progression, particularly in conditions such as sudden death and enzymatic complex I deficiency. These results highlight the importance of understanding drug interactions at the molecular and cellular levels to develop more effective therapeutic strategies.

51546165|a|This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological interactions of the sequence variants D90A and c.429_452dup in the context of Rhodiola rosea and their effects on cell line responses to Amphetamine and Methamphetamine. The research focuses on the association between D90A and Methamphetamine, as well as the positive correlation between D90A and Amphetamine. Additionally, the study explores the relationship between c.429_452dup and Methamphetamine, and the association between keratan sulfate and c.429_452dup.   Using hRPTEC and SNU-C2A cell lines, we observed that the presence of D90A significantly enhances the cellular response to Methamphetamine, consistent with a positive correlation between these two entities. Similarly, the positive correlation between D90A and Amphetamine was confirmed through functional assays in Ba/F3 cells. The sequence variant rs17250932 was found to be positively correlated with Amphetamine, and its association with L-365,260 was further validated through pharmacological experiments.   The c.429_452dup variant was linked to keratan sulfate, suggesting a potential role in modulating the extracellular matrix in response to pharmacological agents. Furthermore, the study included experiments with E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to assess the broader implications of these genetic variants in microbial systems.   The findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and pharmacological agents, particularly in the context of Rhodiola rosea and its potential therapeutic applications. The results also underscore the importance of understanding these interactions in diverse biological systems, including rabbit models and Toxorynchites mosquitoes, to better predict and manage drug responses in different organisms.

14045130|t|Genetic and functional analysis of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3, type I TGFb receptors, and raptor in Daucus carota and Mangifera indica Linn ce
14045130|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional interactions between Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3, type I TGFb receptors, and raptor in the context of Daucus carota and Mangifera indica Linn. Using HeLa cell lines, we examined the association between rs25531 and type I TGFb receptors, as well as the association between rs25531 and raptor. The sequence variant p.F366L was found to be associated with type I TGFb receptors and raptor, suggesting a potential functional role in modulating these pathways.   We observed a negative correlation between type I TGFb receptors and raptor, as well as a negative correlation between Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 and type I TGFb receptors. Additionally, a negative correlation was noted between Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 and raptor. Functional assays confirmed a bind between Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 and raptor, as well as a bind between raptor and Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3. These findings suggest a complex regulatory network involving these proteins in both Daucus carota and Mangifera indica Linn.   The presence of rs25531 in multiple instances across the study highlights its potential role in modulating the interactions between these proteins. Furthermore, the association between p.F366L and raptor supports the hypothesis that sequence variants may influence the functional dynamics of these molecular pathways. Our results provide new insights into the genetic and functional relationships among Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3, type I TGFb receptors, and raptor in plant systems, with implications for understanding their roles in cellular signaling and stress responses.

64015799|t|Vinblastine, gynecologic malignancy, and LPG: insights from Kilham rat virus and Drosophil
64015799|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between vinblastine, gynecologic malignancy, and LPG, with emerging evidence suggesting a significant association between vinblastine and both LPG and gynecologic malignancy. This research explores these relationships through the lens of Kilham rat virus and Drosophila models, which provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.   Vinblastine, a well-known microtubule inhibitor, has been shown to exhibit a strong association with gynecologic malignancy, particularly in the context of its effects on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. This association is further supported by its impact on the expression of key genes involved in tumor progression. Additionally, vinblastine has been found to interact with LPG, a phenotypic feature associated with various metabolic and developmental disorders, suggesting a potential role in modulating cellular responses to environmental stressors.  The study also incorporates the use of RAW 264.7 and LNCaP cell lines to investigate the effects of vinblastine on cellular behavior, with particular attention to the influence of sequence variants such as p.Arg104, -616C/G, and rs861019. These variants, which are prevalent in both human and model organisms, may contribute to the differential response to vinblastine observed in various cell types.   Furthermore, the role of Kilham rat virus and Drosophila as model systems is explored, with a focus on how these organisms can be used to study the broader implications of vinblastine exposure on disease progression and phenotypic outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in understanding the complex relationships between vinblastine, gynecologic malignancy, and LPG.

22740756|t|Zinc, cyclin D1, and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin interactions in bradycardia and Malaria Infection: a multi-speci
22740756|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between zinc, cyclin D1, des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin, and bradycardia across multiple species, including rabbits, Escherichia coli, and chick. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between zinc and bradycardia, suggesting that zinc may have a protective role against this cardiac condition. Similarly, we observed a negative correlation between des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin and bradycardia, indicating that elevated levels of this protein may be associated with reduced cardiac rhythm disturbances. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between a-smooth muscle actin and bradycardia, highlighting the potential involvement of smooth muscle dynamics in cardiac function.   The study also explores the relationship between Malaria Infection and cyclin D1, revealing a negative correlation that suggests cyclin D1 may play a role in modulating the host's response to the parasite. Furthermore, a negative correlation was identified between zinc and Malaria Infection, implying that zinc deficiency may exacerbate the severity of the disease. These findings were corroborated across multiple organisms, including rabbits, Escherichia coli, and chick, indicating that the observed relationships may have broader biological relevance.  In addition to these findings, the study also examines the role of other genes and proteins, such as CASP8, TBX1, and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin, in the context of malonic aciduria and HBV infection. The results contribute to a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of zinc in maintaining cardiovascular health and its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions such as bradycardia and Malaria Infection. The use of chick and Escherichia coli models further underscores the utility of these organisms in studying complex biological interactions at the molecular level.

31338420|t|Hippocalcin and MCT4 in Daucus carota: genetic variants, colitis associations, and functional impl
31338420|a|Hippocalcin, a calcium-binding protein, has been implicated in various physiological processes, including inflammation and immune response regulation. In this study, we investigate the role of hippocalcin in the context of colitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between hippocalcin expression and the development of colitis in Daucus carota, a plant species used as a model for studying gene-environment interactions. This correlation is further supported by the presence of the sequence variant p.Tyr65X, which is associated with altered hippocalcin function and increased susceptibility to colitis.   The sequence variant rs11891426, which is linked to p.Tyr65X, shows a significant association with colitis in Daucus carota. Additionally, the sequence variant G/C, which is prevalent in this species, is found to be associated with colitis, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis. The gene MCT4, which encodes a monocarboxylate transporter, is also examined in this study. MCT4 is found to be upregulated in colitic tissues, and its expression is positively correlated with the severity of colitis.   Our results highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants, gene expression, and disease phenotypes in Daucus carota. The presence of multiple instances of p.Tyr65X, rs11891426, and G/C in this study underscores the importance of these sequence variants in modulating the risk of colitis. Furthermore, the association between MCT4 and colitis suggests that this gene may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying colitis and the role of genetic variation in disease susceptibility.

44443228|t|Vps2 Expression Dynamics in DEN-4-Infected Cells: Correlations with Small-Cell Carcinoma and Bladder Tumor Progression in hRPTEC and RAW 264.7 Ce
44443228|a|This study investigates the expression dynamics of the Vps2 gene in DEN-4-infected hRPTEC and RAW 264.7 cell lines, with a focus on its correlation with small-cell carcinoma and bladder tumor progression. Using quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assays, we observed a significant negative correlation between Vps2 expression and the development of small-cell carcinoma in hRPTEC cells, as well as a positive correlation between Vps2 and bladder tumor formation in RAW 264.7 cells. These findings suggest that Vps2 may act as a tumor suppressor in bladder tumor progression but may have a dual role in small-cell carcinoma, where it exhibits both positive and negative correlations depending on the cellular context. The study also highlights the role of DEN-4 in modulating Vps2 expression, with consistent downregulation observed in both hRPTEC and RAW 264.7 cell lines under DEN-4 infection. Further, the data indicate that the relationship between Vps2 and bladder tumor is more complex than previously thought, with evidence of both positive and negative correlations across different experimental conditions. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between Vps2, DEN-4, and the development of small-cell carcinoma and bladder tumor in various cell line models.

20722342|t|Genetic Variants and Molecular Interactions in UCHL1, Vg4, and VEGF Receptor 2 in H
20722342|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and functional associations between genetic variants and gene products in the context of HK2 cells. We focus on the sequence variant IVS3+1G>A, which is associated with UCHL1 and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, and also linked to Vg4 and VEGF receptor 2. The sequence variant methionine (ATG) by threonine (ACG) at codon 453 is found to be associated with UCHL1, Vg4, and VEGF receptor 2, highlighting its potential role in modulating these gene products. Additionally, the sequence variant G135C is associated with Sox13, VEGF receptor 2, and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, suggesting a complex regulatory network.   In HK2 cells, we observed a positive correlation between Vg4 and VEGF receptor 2, as well as between Vg4 and UCHL1. The positive correlation between UCHL1 and Vg4 further supports the functional interplay between these gene products. Moreover, the positive correlation between UCHL1 and Sox13, along with the positive correlation between Sox13 and UCHL1, indicates a potential regulatory relationship. The positive correlation between protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 and Sox13, as well as between protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 and VEGF receptor 2, suggests that these gene products may be part of a shared regulatory pathway.   The association between IVS3+1G>A and UCHL1, along with its link to protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 and Vg4, underscores the importance of this variant in modulating gene expression. The association between IVS3+1G>A and VEGF receptor 2 further supports its role in the regulation of this receptor. The positive correlation between VEGF receptor 2 and Vg4, as well as between VEGF receptor 2 and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, reinforces the interconnectedness of these gene products.   Our findings provide evidence for the complex genetic and molecular interactions involving UCHL1, Vg4, VEGF receptor 2, and their associated variants in HK2 cells, offering new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying these gene products.

27960827|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in gynecologic malignancy: roles of 2,4-diene-VPA, anthracycline, and CAA in modulating CAG repeat and sequence 
27960827|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and disease progression in gynecologic malignancy. This research investigates the associations between 2,4-diene-VPA and the CAG repeat, as well as the sequence variant rs2844580, in the context of cancer biology. Additionally, the drug interactions between anthracycline and lactate, anthracycline and CAA, and lactate and CAA are explored to understand their potential therapeutic implications.   The study also examines the association between CAA and the sequence variant c.304ins(GCG)(7), which is linked to altered protein function in cellular processes. Furthermore, the drug interaction between 2,4-diene-VPA and lactate is analyzed, revealing potential metabolic pathways that may influence tumor response to treatment.   In vitro experiments using the cell line SCID-HuH-7 and the cell line C4-2B demonstrate that anthracycline significantly modulates the activity of lactate and CAA, suggesting a role in metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. The association between 2,4-diene-VPA and rs1800587 is further supported by functional assays, which show altered gene expression patterns in response to the compound.   The study also explores the interaction between 2,4-diene-VPA and the sequence variant (proline) with a polar amino acid (serine) at position 29, indicating a potential mechanism for altered protein stability. The role of the organism taxon Toxorynchites mosquitoes in the transmission of pathogens associated with gynecologic malignancy is discussed, along with the impact of Rhodiola rosea and Aedes mosquitoes on immune responses in guinea pigs.   The drug interaction between Serum aminotransferase and anthracycline is further validated through biochemical assays, highlighting the importance of monitoring liver function during anthracycline therapy. Overall, these findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic and pharmacological factors that influence the progression and treatment of gynecologic malignancy.

49867837|t|Genetic and molecular interactions of DISC1, GLDC, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in bladder dysfunction and keloid disease: insights from Daucus carota and Dan
49867837|a|This study investigates the molecular and genetic interactions between the gene products DISC1, GLDC, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in the context of bladder dysfunction and keloid disease. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we explored the functional relationships between these proteins and their potential roles in disease pathogenesis. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between DISC1 and GLDC, as well as between GLDC and ERK-1/2, suggesting a regulatory network that may be disrupted in bladder dysfunction. Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between GLDC and mTOR, and between ERK-1/2 and GLDC, further supporting the involvement of these pathways in disease progression.   The study also identified a negative correlation between DISC1 and mTOR, and a binding interaction between DISC1 and both gamma-H2AX and ERK-1/2. These interactions were further supported by the binding of gamma-H2AX to mTOR and the binding of mTOR to ERK-1/2. Notably, a negative correlation was found between follistatin and both gamma-H2AX and ERK-1/2, with a binding interaction between follistatin and mTOR. These results suggest a complex regulatory network involving these proteins in the pathogenesis of bladder dysfunction and keloid disease.  In addition to these findings, the study examined the association between the sequence variant p.T286M and DISC1, as well as between A6V and both GLDC and follistatin. These associations highlight the potential role of specific genetic variants in modulating the expression and function of these proteins. The study also included the organism taxon Daucus carota and Danio rerio as model systems to explore the broader implications of these interactions in different biological contexts. Overall, this research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder dysfunction and keloid disease, with potential applications in the development of targeted therapies.

77150787|t|C4A, TGF-induced protein, and nitric oxide synthase interactions in human immunodeficiency virus and Kilham rat virus in
77150787|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between C4A, TGF-induced protein, and nitric oxide synthase in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Kilham rat virus (KRV) infections. Using a combination of biochemical assays and cell line models, we demonstrate that C4A binds to nitric oxide synthase in both HIV-infected and uninfected C4-2B cells. Additionally, TGF-induced protein also binds to nitric oxide synthase, suggesting a potential role for this interaction in modulating immune responses.   Our findings reveal a complex network of negative correlations between these proteins. Specifically, nitric oxide synthase exhibits a negative correlation with both C4A and TGF-induced protein, as well as with itself in SMMC-7721 and CA3 cell lines. Furthermore, C4A shows a negative correlation with TGF-induced protein, indicating a possible regulatory relationship among these molecules. These interactions are further explored in the context of Escherichia coli and ginseng, which are known to influence immune signaling pathways.   The results suggest that the interplay between C4A, TGF-induced protein, and nitric oxide synthase may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral infections, including HIV and KRV. These findings provide a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and their implications in disease progression.

70436049|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in cellular models: associations between sequence variants, chemical entities, and gene 
70436049|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic variants, chemical entities, and gene products in various cell lines to elucidate their functional and regulatory relationships. We focused on the effects of sequence variants such as 'insertion of the four nucleotides CCCC', 'c. 1093-1G>T', '4153delA', 'A to G', 'Leu269Phe', 'p.G705RfsX16', and 'G1103R' on gene expression and cellular responses. Additionally, we examined the impact of chemical entities including 'Clopidogrel', 'verapamil', 'eGFP', 'noradrenaline', 'CE', and 'anisomycin' on these interactions.   Our findings reveal a significant association between the insertion of the four nucleotides CCCC and both CD3 and Vps24, suggesting a potential role in immune signaling and vesicle trafficking. The sequence variant 'c. 1093-1G>T' shows a positive correlation with eGFP, indicating a possible regulatory effect on gene expression. The variant '4153delA' is associated with Vps24 and positively correlates with CE, highlighting its involvement in cellular processes related to endosomal function.   The chemical entity 'Clopidogrel' exhibits a positive correlation with both noradrenaline and CE, suggesting a synergistic effect in modulating cellular responses. 'Verapamil' is positively correlated with CE and eGFP, indicating its role in modulating gene expression and cellular signaling. The variant 'G1103R' is positively correlated with verapamil, suggesting a potential pharmacogenetic interaction.   The variant 'p.G705RfsX16' is associated with CD3 and positively correlates with eGFP, pointing to its involvement in immune-related pathways. The 'A to G' variant shows a positive correlation with both Clopidogrel and anisomycin, indicating a possible role in drug response.   These results were obtained using cell lines such as HEK293, Ishikawa, SJ-GBM2, MCF7/AdrR, C57BL/6J, and PC-3, which provided a diverse cellular context for studying these interactions. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic and pharmacological interactions in cellular systems.

62828802|t|SNU-C5 cell line responses to Pilocarpine and escitalopram: associations with insulitis, muscular dystrophy, and gastrointestinal (GI) 
62828802|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between chemical entities and biological systems in the context of disease progression. This study focuses on the SNU-C5 cell line, a well-characterized model for investigating cellular responses to pharmacological agents. We examined the effects of Pilocarpine and escitalopram on the SNU-C5 cell line, with particular emphasis on their associations with insulitis, muscular dystrophy, and gastrointestinal (GI) hormones.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between Pilocarpine and insulitis, as well as between Pilocarpine and muscular dystrophy. Similarly, escitalopram shows a positive correlation with both muscular dystrophy and insulitis. These associations were further supported by the observation that gastrointestinal (GI) hormones are positively correlated with both muscular dystrophy and insulitis. Additionally, keratin 1 was found to be associated with gastrointestinal (GI) hormones, Pilocarpine, and escitalopram, highlighting its potential role in mediating these interactions.  The study also identified associations between IFN and Pilocarpine, IFN and escitalopram, and IFN and gastrointestinal (GI) hormones, suggesting a broader regulatory network involving these factors. Furthermore, SKP2 was found to be associated with propranolol, gastrointestinal (GI) hormones, and escitalopram, reinforcing its involvement in multiple pathways. Notably, propranolol was positively correlated with both muscular dystrophy and insulitis, and its association with keratin 1 was also confirmed.  These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between chemical entities and disease states, particularly in the context of the SNU-C5 cell line. The findings may have implications for the development of targeted therapies for conditions such as muscular dystrophy and insulitis, with potential applications in both human and rhesus monkey models.

52376118|t|Genetic and molecular interactions of CYP2F1, ALDH1B1, ETV6, and miR-483-3p in the context of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and Ca2+ s
52376118|a|Recent studies have uncovered complex genetic and molecular interactions among several key genes and sequence variants in the context of lipid metabolism and Ca2+ signaling. A notable association was found between the gene products ETV6 and ALDH1B1, with further evidence supporting a bidirectional relationship between these two genes. Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between ETV6 and ALDH1B1, suggesting a regulatory interplay that may influence cellular responses to environmental stimuli.    The sequence variant His626Arg showed a positive correlation with lipid-linked oligosaccharides, indicating a potential role in modulating glycosylation pathways. This variant also exhibited a positive correlation with Ca2+ levels, while a negative correlation was noted between Ca2+ and Ecstasy, highlighting the complex interplay between neurotransmitter activity and intracellular signaling.    The gene CYP2F1 was found to be associated with GLP1R, and a negative correlation was observed between GLP1R and CYP2F1, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that may influence metabolic responses. Furthermore, miR-483-3p was associated with CYP2F1, indicating a potential role for microRNA regulation in the expression of this enzyme.    The sequence variant P163S was found to be associated with lipid-linked oligosaccharides, reinforcing the role of sequence variation in modulating metabolic pathways. The gene Cidea was associated with ETV6, and this relationship was further supported by a negative correlation between GLP1R and ETV6.    In addition, a positive correlation was observed between Ca2+ and the sequence variant -616C/G, suggesting a potential role for this polymorphism in Ca2+ homeostasis. These findings collectively highlight the intricate network of genetic and molecular interactions that may underlie various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in the context of human immunodeficiency virus infection and metabolic disorders.

16591463|t|Genetic variants in XBP1 and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter modulate Darier's disease and their interactions with vancomycin and KU7 cell line r
16591463|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying Darier's disease, focusing on the interplay between genetic variants, protein interactions, and cellular responses in the KU7 cell line. We identified three instances of the sequence variant IVS51 + 1G-->A, which showed a positive correlation with the manifestation of Darier's disease. Similarly, six instances of the sequence variant p.W111X were found to be positively correlated with the development of Darier's disease. These findings suggest that both variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of the condition through distinct molecular pathways.   In addition, we examined the interactions between the gene products XBP1 and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter with the chemical entity vancomycin. The results demonstrated a significant bind between XBP1 and vancomycin, as well as a bind between Na-K-2Cl cotransporter and vancomycin. These interactions were further validated using the KU7 cell line, which exhibited consistent responses to vancomycin treatment in the presence of these gene products.   The study also included six instances of Darier's disease in the KU7 cell line model, highlighting the potential of this cell line as a tool for studying the disease at the molecular level. The repeated occurrence of the sequence variants and the consistent interactions observed in the KU7 cell line provide strong evidence for the role of these genetic and molecular factors in the pathophysiology of Darier's disease. Furthermore, the presence of vancomycin in the experimental setup underscores the importance of drug-protein interactions in modulating disease-related pathways.

52709947|t|CGK-733 and telaprevir interactions with TP53, anemia, and genetic variants in diverse disease 
52709947|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between the chemical entity CGK-733, the cell line SNU-C2A, and the gene TP53 in the context of anemia and various sequence variants. CGK-733 has been shown to exhibit a positive correlation with alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, while simultaneously displaying a negative correlation with telaprevir. This dual relationship is further supported by the negative correlation between telaprevir and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, and the positive correlation between telaprevir and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, highlighting the intricate pharmacological interactions among these compounds.   The cell line SNU-C2A has been associated with multiple genetic variants, including A1359, p.C615R, and +3100 T/G. Notably, anemia has been found to have a positive correlation with both A1359 and p.C615R, as well as with +3100 T/G. These findings suggest that anemia may be influenced by multiple genetic factors, including the sequence variants A1359, p.C615R, and +3100 T/G. Additionally, the association between anemia and p.C615R has been reinforced by multiple studies, further supporting the role of this variant in disease progression.  The gene TP53 has been linked to several disease phenotypes, including anemia, dystonia, and oligodontia phenotype. TP53 has also been associated with the cell lines SNU-C2A, C4-2B, and PC-3, and with the sequence variants A1359 and +3100 T/G. The positive correlation between TP53 and oligodontia phenotype, as well as the positive correlation between TP53 and p.C615R, suggests a potential role for TP53 in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Furthermore, the association between TP53 and angioedema indicates a broader involvement of this gene in diverse disease states.  The sequence variant A1359 has been associated with multiple disease phenotypes, including anemia, angioedema, and non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness. The positive correlation between A1359 and non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness, as well as the positive correlation between A1359 and alkaptonuria, underscores the importance of this variant in genetic disease. Similarly, the positive correlation between +3100 T/G and non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness, as well as the positive correlation between +3100 T/G and alkaptonuria, further supports the role of this variant in disease mechanisms.  These findings collectively suggest that the interplay between chemical entities, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes is complex and multifaceted, with implications for both basic research and clinical applications.

75368012|t|Pirenzepine and IPA-3 Modulate Dopamine Signaling in Diverse Models: A Comparative Study of Leu, Valproate, and Methylmalo
75368012|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between pirenzepine, IPA-3, and Dopamine across multiple biological systems, including mammalian and model organisms. We demonstrate a significant association between IPA-3 and pirenzepine, suggesting a potential synergistic effect in modulating dopaminergic pathways. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between Leu and Dopamine, which is further supported by a positive correlation between IPA-3 and Dopamine. These findings are consistent across both in vitro and in vivo models, including the cell lines MES-SA/Dx5 and CD18/HPAF, as well as the organism taxon Danio rerio.   The cotreatment of Dopamine and valproate reveals a unique pharmacological profile, with valproate showing a significant association with Leu. Furthermore, we report a negative correlation between methylmalonic acid and valproate, indicating a possible antagonistic relationship. This relationship is further explored in the context of bovine and S. cerevisiae models, where valproate's effects on methylmalonic acid levels are consistently observed.   In addition, we examine the effects of valproate in the context of Spirulina and Mangifera indica Linn, where its interactions with other chemical entities and biological systems are further characterized. The study also includes the cell line SNU-C2A, where valproate's impact on methylmalonic acid levels is further validated. These findings highlight the multifaceted role of valproate in modulating various biochemical pathways and underscore the importance of understanding its interactions with other compounds in diverse biological contexts.

96240813|t|Functional characterization of sequence variants in 293T and Huh7 cells: interactions with alcohol, pirenzepine, and 4
96240813|a|This study investigates the functional consequences of sequence variants in 293T and Huh7 cell lines, with a focus on their interactions with alcohol, pirenzepine, and 4-ene-VPA. The sequence variant (CCTTT)13 was found to significantly alter the response of 293T cells to alcohol exposure, suggesting a potential association between (CCTTT)13 and alcohol metabolism. In contrast, the variant D299G showed a strong association with alcohol-induced changes in Huh7 cell viability, further supporting the link between D299G and alcohol.   A comparative analysis between pirenzepine and alcohol revealed that pirenzepine modulates the cellular response to alcohol in both 293T and Huh7 cells, indicating a potential therapeutic role for pirenzepine in mitigating alcohol-related toxicity. Additionally, the conversion of 4-ene-VPA to alcohol was observed in RAW 264.7 cells, suggesting a metabolic pathway that may be relevant in the context of alcohol metabolism.   The comparison between alcohol and 4-ene-VPA highlighted distinct effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis in 293T and Huh7 cells, with 4-ene-VPA showing a more pronounced protective effect against alcohol-induced damage. Furthermore, the association between D299G and 4-ene-VPA was confirmed through multiple experiments, demonstrating that D299G enhances the efficacy of 4-ene-VPA in reducing alcohol toxicity.   These findings provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between sequence variants, alcohol, pirenzepine, and 4-ene-VPA, with implications for the development of targeted therapies in alcohol-related disorders.

89881840|t|Genetic and molecular interactions of Rab6c, CD28, and NBS1 in asthma, stroke, and hepatic failure: implications for disease mechanisms and therapeutic st
89881840|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic factors and disease phenotypes in the context of asthma, stroke, and hepatic failure. This research explores the molecular and genetic relationships among Rab6c, CD28, and NBS1, with a focus on their roles in asthma, stroke, and hepatic failure. The findings reveal a positive correlation between asthma and CD28, suggesting that CD28 may play a protective role in asthma pathogenesis. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between asthma and Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, indicating a potential antagonistic relationship.   In the context of stroke, a negative correlation was found between stroke and NBS1, which contrasts with a previously reported positive correlation. This discrepancy suggests that NBS1 may have context-dependent effects on stroke outcomes. Additionally, the study identified a negative correlation between hepatic failure and aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein, implying that this protein may contribute to the progression of hepatic failure.   The research also examined the role of Rab6c in these conditions, with two instances of Rab6c mentioned, suggesting its involvement in multiple disease pathways. The chemical entities dUTP and GTP were found to be associated with these genetic interactions, potentially modulating the activity of Rab6c and other proteins. Triamcinolone diacetate, a corticosteroid, was also implicated in the regulation of asthma-related pathways, further emphasizing the role of chemical entities in disease modulation.  The study included a diverse range of organisms, including humans, HPV, and Zebrafish, to assess the conservation of these genetic and molecular interactions. The findings from rhesus monkeys and guinea pigs provided additional support for the observed correlations. Furthermore, the presence of rDEN2 and Aedes mosquitoes in the study highlights the potential role of viral and vector-borne factors in disease progression.   Overall, this research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic and molecular underpinnings of asthma, stroke, and hepatic failure, with implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

67180956|t|Thromboxane, dUTP, and genetic variants in myopia and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: a multi-cellular and multi-variant 
67180956|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between Thromboxane, dUTP, and genetic variants in the context of myopia and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we examined the effects of these factors on cellular function and disease progression. The IEC-6 and Mz-ChA-1 cell lines were employed to assess the role of dUTP in modulating Thromboxane signaling, while the DUCaP and hRPTEC cell lines were used to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on disease-related pathways.   Our findings reveal a significant association between dUTP and adrenergic antagonists, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism in cellular responses to stress. Furthermore, we observed a strong link between dUTP and myopia, with the sequence variant p.W290L showing a notable correlation with the development of myopia. The disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was found to be associated with multiple genetic variants, including the 1123T-->G, 137-bp insertion, and rs2070197 variants, indicating a complex genetic architecture underlying this condition.   Additionally, the association between focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and adrenergic antagonists was confirmed, highlighting the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways. The sequence variant A49T was also found to be linked to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, further supporting the role of genetic variability in disease susceptibility. The study also included the HeLa cell line to explore the broader implications of these associations across different cellular contexts.   These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying myopia and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and suggest that the interplay between Thromboxane, dUTP, and genetic variants may represent a key area for future therapeutic development.

91646468|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between the JNK signaling pathway and the insulin-receptor in BALB/c cells exposed to methylphenidate. Using a combination of biochemical assays and gene expression profiling, we demonstrate a significant association between JNK and insulin-receptor in BALB/c cell lines. The interaction was further validated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which showed a direct physical association between JNK and insulin-receptor in BALB/c cells. Additionally, treatment with methylphenidate was found to modulate the expression levels of both JNK and insulin-receptor in BALB/c cells, suggesting a potential regulatory role of methylphenidate in this signaling network. Functional assays revealed that the JNK-insulin-receptor complex plays a critical role in mediating cellular responses to methylphenidate in BALB/c cells. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of methylphenidate on JNK and insulin-receptor signaling in BALB/c cell lines.

78447847|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between asparagine, Telaprevir, and Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) in the context of tobacco, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and ginseng. We focus on the regulatory roles of NF1 and serine/threonine protein kinase (STK) in these interactions. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between FGFR4 and both activin and NF1, suggesting that FGFR4 may act as a key mediator in these pathways. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between Telaprevir and STK, as well as between Telaprevir and activin, indicating potential inhibitory effects of Telaprevir on these pathways. The conversion between asparagine and Telaprevir is also demonstrated, highlighting a dynamic interplay between these chemical entities. Notably, asparagine shows a negative correlation with both NF1 and activin, suggesting a regulatory role in these processes. The study further explores the impact of tobacco and ginseng on these interactions, with tobacco being found to modulate the expression of STK in S. cerevisiae. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between these biological entities and their potential therapeutic implications.

31536453|a|This study investigates the effects of fluoroquinolone exposure on bovine renal tract abnormalities and cortical dysplasia, with a focus on metabolic interactions involving aminotransferase, phloridzin, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Using multiple cell lines including MEF, 253JB-V, and H9c2, we observed a significant association between fluoroquinolones and renal tract abnormalities, as well as a positive correlation between fluoroquinolones and cortical dysplasia. The association between renal tract abnormalities and aminotransferase was confirmed through biochemical assays, and a positive correlation between renal tract abnormalities and aminotransferase was further supported by transcriptomic analysis. Additionally, a positive correlation between cortical dysplasia and phloridzin was identified, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for phloridzin in mitigating cortical dysplasia. The drug interaction between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and aminotransferase was validated through enzyme kinetics, and a positive correlation between cortical dysplasia and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate was observed. Furthermore, a drug interaction between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and phloridzin was demonstrated, highlighting the complex interplay between these metabolic compounds. The study also included bovine and Platonia insignis Mart as model organisms, with findings relevant to both species. The results provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of fluoroquinolones and their interactions with key metabolic pathways in bovine and other cell lines, including SMMC-7721, LNCaP, 293T, Ishikawa, KU7, and MC3T3-E1.

61807888|t|TIPE2 and p38 MAPK: Interactions and associations with febrile neutropenia, arrhythmia, and mucolipidosis I
61807888|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of TIPE2 in modulating inflammatory responses and its interactions with key signaling pathways such as p38 MAPK and TAK1. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between TIPE2 and p38 MAPK, as well as the functional interplay between TIPE2 and TAK1. The findings reveal a direct binding interaction between p38 MAPK and TIPE2, which is further supported by the observed association between febrile neutropenia and p38 MAPK. Additionally, the study demonstrates that TAK1 is significantly linked to arrhythmia, and this association is reinforced by the binding of TIPE2 to TAK1. Notably, both TAK1 and TIPE2 are found to be associated with mucolipidosis III gamma, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this lysosomal storage disorder. Furthermore, the study identifies a novel association between p38 MAPK and arrhythmia, expanding the understanding of how these signaling molecules contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between TIPE2, p38 MAPK, and TAK1 in the context of febrile neutropenia, arrhythmia, and mucolipidosis III gamma.

48352878|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between the estrogen receptor and D2 DA receptors in the context of genetic variability. Using Huh7 and C57BL/6J cell lines, we demonstrate a significant association between the estrogen receptor and D2 DA receptors, suggesting a potential functional link in signal transduction pathways. Additionally, we identify a sequence variant, deletion of C at nucleotide 888, that is associated with the estrogen receptor, indicating a possible regulatory role in gene expression. The sequence variant L490R is also found to be associated with the estrogen receptor, further supporting the hypothesis of functional interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of genetic variability in modulating receptor function and provide a foundation for future studies on the role of these variants in disease mechanisms. The presence of other sequence variants, including p.R198W, G7958, G1103R, and G196S, suggests a complex genetic landscape that may influence receptor activity and downstream signaling. These results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of estrogen receptor function and its interactions with other signaling pathways.

40885526|a|This study investigates the genetic associations between specific sequence variants in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and phenotypic features such as isolated micropenis, as well as their potential impact on tobacco use and other traits in guinea pigs and horses. We identified three instances of the sequence variant g.3318-35T>G, two instances of c.1146+25insA, and one instance of C1007G in HIV-1 isolates. Additionally, we observed two instances of D374Y and three instances of C1007G, with a notable association between D374Y and C1007G. The sequence variant g.3318-35T>G was found to be in strong linkage with c.1146+25insA, and also showed a significant association with C1007G. A positive correlation was observed between isolated micropenis and c.1146+25insA, suggesting a potential genetic link between this variant and the phenotypic feature. Furthermore, the study included analyses of tobacco and Mangifera indica Linn in the context of these genetic variants, with guinea pigs and horses serving as model organisms to explore the broader implications of these associations. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic variability in HIV-1 and phenotypic outcomes across different species.

93149159|t|Mesna and bacterial interactions in renal insufficiency: a study using DUCaP and 253JB-V ce
93149159|a|Mesna, a chemical entity known for its protective effects against renal insufficiency, was investigated in this study for its potential to modulate bacterial interactions in the context of renal insufficiency. The study focused on two cell lines, DUCaP and 253JB-V, which are frequently used to model renal insufficiency and bacterial infections. Mesna was found to significantly reduce the incidence of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in both DUCaP and 253JB-V cell lines. This effect was observed across multiple experiments, with mesna showing consistent inhibition of bacterial growth in the presence of renal insufficiency. The study also highlighted the role of mesna in altering the expression of bacterial virulence factors, which may contribute to its protective effects. The findings suggest that mesna could be a promising therapeutic agent for managing bacterial infections in patients with renal insufficiency. The results were validated using multiple cell line models, including DUCaP and 253JB-V, and were consistent across all tested bacterial strains. Mesna's ability to modulate bacterial behavior in the context of renal insufficiency was further supported by its impact on the expression of key bacterial genes involved in pathogenesis. The study underscores the importance of mesna in the treatment of bacterial infections associated with renal insufficiency and highlights the potential of DUCaP and 253JB-V cell lines as valuable tools for future research in this area.

18527425|a|This study investigates the intricate relationships between anthracyclines, fatty acid synthase, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and their associations with cystic kidney disease, pneumonitis, and malignant hyperthermia. We demonstrate that anthracyclines can be converted into dopamine and 8-hydroxyguanine, highlighting their dual role in both metabolic and oxidative stress pathways. Furthermore, we show that dopamine can be converted into 8-hydroxyguanine and is also involved in a conversion with antibiotics, suggesting a potential link between these chemical entities in cellular signaling.   The study also reveals a negative correlation between bone morphogenetic protein-2 and both cystic kidney disease and malignant hyperthermia, indicating that the expression of this gene product may be suppressed in these conditions. Additionally, we find a negative correlation between bone morphogenetic protein-2 and Btg3, suggesting a regulatory relationship between these two gene products.   Temsirolimus is shown to be associated with Btg3, which may have implications for therapeutic strategies targeting this gene product. Moreover, fatty acid synthase exhibits a positive correlation with both anthracyclines and dopamine, and a negative correlation with bone morphogenetic protein-2, underscoring its role in metabolic regulation.   The study also reports a negative correlation between Btg3 and pneumonitis, suggesting that Btg3 may act as a protective factor against this condition. Finally, we observe a negative correlation between dopamine and cystic kidney disease, reinforcing the idea that dopamine signaling may be disrupted in this disease state. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between these molecular entities in disease pathogenesis.

87979038|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in a multifactorial model involving diffuse mesangial sclerosis, radiation injury, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. We focus on the role of sequence variants such as T3801C and V175M, and their potential interactions with chemical entities like Fluo3, TG, leucine, tempol, and thapsigargin. The study also explores the impact of organism taxa including HBV, HIV 1/2, and Toxorynchites mosquitoes on disease progression and response to treatment.   A key finding is the conversion between TG and thapsigargin, suggesting a potential metabolic pathway that may be relevant in the context of radiation injury and proteinuria. We also observed a positive correlation between dengue and Fluo3, indicating a possible role for Fluo3 in the immune response to dengue infection. Additionally, the conversion between leucine and tempol was confirmed, highlighting the importance of metabolic pathways in cellular stress responses.   The positive correlation between proteinuria and tempol suggests that tempol may play a protective role in kidney function, particularly in conditions such as diffuse mesangial sclerosis. Furthermore, the positive correlation between radiation injury and thyroid hormones indicates a potential regulatory mechanism in the body's response to radiation exposure.   The conversion between tempol and thapsigargin was also demonstrated, reinforcing the interconnectedness of these chemical entities in cellular defense mechanisms. Lastly, the conversion between Fluo3 and urethane was identified, suggesting a possible role for Fluo3 in the metabolism of urethane, a known carcinogen.   The study also included guinea pigs as a model organism to assess the effects of these interactions in vivo, providing further evidence for the complex relationships between genetic, chemical, and environmental factors in disease pathogenesis.

15438079|a|This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological interactions between sequence variants and pegylated interferon in the context of Capan1 and hRPTEC cell lines. We focused on the sequence variants c.429_452dup, CAG repeat, four-basepair deletion, and rs2073163, and their potential interactions with pegylated interferon. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between pegylated interferon and all four sequence variants, suggesting a possible mechanism by which pegylated interferon may modulate gene expression or cellular response in these cell lines.   In Capan1 cells, the presence of c.429_452dup was associated with increased sensitivity to pegylated interferon, as evidenced by enhanced antiviral activity and altered cytokine profiles. Similarly, in hRPTEC cells, the CAG repeat and four-basepair deletion showed a positive correlation with pegylated interferon treatment, leading to increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes. The rs2073163 variant also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with pegylated interferon, suggesting a potential role in modulating the immune response.   These results highlight the complex interplay between sequence variants and pegylated interferon, with implications for personalized medicine and therapeutic strategies in diseases involving these genetic elements. The study underscores the importance of considering genetic variability when evaluating the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon in different cell types and patient populations.

29578586|t|Genetic Variants and Cardiac Defects: Association of AVSD with GLUT4, Tcf12, and Promoter Polymorphisms in Toxorynchites Mo
29578586|a|This study investigates the genetic underpinnings of atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) in the context of Toxorynchites mosquitoes, with a focus on the interplay between sequence variants, gene expression, and developmental phenotypes. Using C57BL/6J cell lines, we examined the impact of the guanine insertion/deletion (G/D), the -1607 promoter polymorphism, and lysine at residue 223 on the expression of key genes such as GLUT4, apolipoprotein B-100, and Tcf12. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between AVSD and the G/D, the -1607 promoter polymorphism, suggesting that this variant may play a role in the pathogenesis of the defect. Additionally, we observed a significant association between AVSD and GLUT4, indicating that alterations in glucose transporter function may contribute to cardiac developmental anomalies. The study also highlights the potential involvement of Tcf12 in modulating the expression of genes associated with AVSD. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying congenital heart defects in Toxorynchites mosquitoes and underscore the importance of genetic variability in developmental biology.

11786861|t|LH-RH and HRH2 interactions in arrhythmic conditions: associations with XPD, caveolin-1, and vascular endothelial-cadherin in dogs, mice, and chic
11786861|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) and its receptor HRH2 in the context of arrhythmic conditions. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that LH-RH binds to HRH2 in both dogs and mice, with a significant association observed between HRH2 and the XPD gene in chick models. The interaction between XPD and HRH2 is further supported by the binding of bisphosphonate and Telaprevir to XPD, suggesting a potential role for these chemical entities in modulating the HRH2-XPD axis.   We also report an association between caveolin-1 and XPD, as well as between caveolin-1 and the thyrotropin receptor, in both mice and chick models. These findings are complemented by the binding of carbohydrate to XPD, which may indicate a metabolic component to the observed interactions. Additionally, the IL-13 gene is found to be associated with both XPD and caveolin-1, suggesting a broader regulatory network involving these genes.   In the context of arrhythmic conditions, the vascular endothelial-cadherin gene is associated with HRH2, highlighting potential roles in cardiac signaling. The study also includes the use of the SF188 and H446 cell lines to further explore these interactions, with the HK-2 cell line used to validate the binding of bisphosphonate to HRH2.   Notably, the study extends to the ginseng plant and the Daucus carota species, where the thyrotropin receptor is found to be associated with multiple instances of the gene, suggesting a possible evolutionary conservation of these interactions. The findings also include the association of the disease Darier's disease with the thyrotropin receptor, and the inherited bleeding disorder with the XPD gene, indicating potential clinical relevance.   The results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between LH-RH, HRH2, XPD, caveolin-1, and other genes in the context of arrhythmic conditions and related phenotypes.

14437841|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic interactions between key genes and their sequence variants in the context of HCT116 and SF188 cell lines. We focus on the associations between the sequence variants c.2444A>C and p.G196S, as well as between 125-126insAA and p.G196S, which were found to be significantly correlated. These variants were analyzed in both cell lines to assess their impact on gene expression and protein function.   The sequence variant c.2444A>C was found to be associated with both Bax and IRF6, suggesting a potential regulatory role in these pathways. Similarly, the insertion variant 125-126insAA showed a strong association with IRF6, further supporting the hypothesis that these variants may influence the expression or activity of IRF6. Additionally, the variant p.G196S was found to be associated with both IRF6 and Bax, indicating a possible functional link between these proteins.  The interaction between Bax and dynein was confirmed through biochemical assays, with a negative correlation observed between dynein and CPT1. This suggests that CPT1 may modulate dynein activity, potentially through a direct or indirect mechanism. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between CPT1 and IRF6, reinforcing the idea of a regulatory network involving these genes.   In HCT116 cells, the association between CPT1 and Bax was also evident, with a positive correlation observed. This finding aligns with the broader pattern of interactions involving these proteins. The study highlights the complex interplay between genetic variants and protein function, particularly in the context of cell line-specific responses. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions.

00017399|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Senior-Loken syndrome in bovine and feline models, with a focus on the interplay between key genes and chemical entities. We examined the expression patterns of MYB, TLR1, VEGF receptor 3, and their correlations with prazosin, Alpha-lipoic acid, ZnSO(4), and norfloxacin in bovine and cat tissues. The findings reveal a complex network of interactions, including a positive correlation between prazosin and VEGF receptor 3, and between VEGF receptor 3 and Alpha-lipoic acid. Additionally, norfloxacin shows a positive correlation with both TLR1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, while ZnSO(4) is positively correlated with VEGF receptor 3, MYB, and TLR1. The study also highlights a negative correlation between MYB and TLR1, as well as between glial fibrillary acidic protein and TLR1. Notably, the gene MYB is positively correlated with prazosin, ZnSO(4), and Alpha-lipoic acid, while it is negatively correlated with glial fibrillary acidic protein. The results further demonstrate that glial fibrillary acidic protein is positively correlated with prazosin, norfloxacin, and Alpha-lipoic acid, and negatively correlated with MYB. These findings suggest that the interplay between these genes and chemical entities may play a critical role in the development of glaucoma and thyrotoxicosis in bovine and feline models. The study also includes data from Mangifera indica Linn, which shows a positive correlation between ZnSO(4) and VEGF receptor 3, and between norfloxacin and MYB. Overall, the research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular basis of Senior-Loken syndrome and its associated phenotypes in these species.

78478689|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic sequence variants and chemical entities in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. We focus on the effects of specific sequence variants such as p.Asp50Asn, g.3318-15C>T, A49T, leucine 269 to phenylalanine, rs1800896, Arg64Trp, and p.R962T, alongside the chemical entities 17-DMAG, 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine, CNSB002, metformin, Vigabatrin, Antioxidant, hexamethonium, and prazosin.   Our findings reveal a drug interaction between Antioxidant and prazosin, suggesting potential synergistic or antagonistic effects in therapeutic applications. A positive correlation was observed between prazosin and 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine, indicating a possible mechanism of action or shared biological pathways. Similarly, metformin showed a positive correlation with 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine, highlighting potential therapeutic synergy.   The association between CNSB002 and g.3318-15C>T suggests a genetic basis for the efficacy or side effects of CNSB002. Conversion between hexamethonium and 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine was also noted, implying a possible metabolic or functional relationship. Additionally, a positive correlation between leucine 269 to phenylalanine and CNSB002 was identified, suggesting a potential role in disease progression or treatment response.   The conversion between hexamethonium and prazosin further supports the idea of shared pharmacological mechanisms. Lastly, a positive correlation between CNSB002 and 17-DMAG was observed, indicating potential therapeutic applications or interactions in neurodegenerative conditions. These results provide a foundation for future research into the molecular and pharmacological mechanisms underlying these interactions.

43651687|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between sodium channel blockers, N-methyl-d-aspartate, DDB, and TMPRSS2 in the context of nephropathy using zebrafish models. We demonstrate that sodium channel blockers bind to TMPRSS2, suggesting a direct molecular interaction that may influence cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, we find a negative correlation between sodium channel blockers and nephropathy, indicating that these compounds may have protective effects against renal damage. In contrast, a positive correlation is observed between nephropathy and DDB, suggesting a potential role for DDB in the progression of kidney disease.   N-methyl-d-aspartate exhibits a negative correlation with DDB, implying that these two entities may function in opposing pathways. Furthermore, N-methyl-d-aspartate shows a negative correlation with TMPRSS2, and there is an association between N-methyl-d-aspartate and TMPRSS2, highlighting a complex regulatory network. The comparison between sodium channel blockers and N-methyl-d-aspartate reveals distinct pharmacological profiles, with sodium channel blockers showing a more pronounced effect on TMPRSS2.   We also report a cotreatment between sodium channel blockers and N-methyl-d-aspartate in LbetaT2 and 253JB-V cell lines, which suggests potential synergistic or antagonistic effects in cellular responses. The study further explores the role of DDB in nephropathy, with evidence supporting its involvement in disease progression. These findings are supported by experiments conducted in zebrafish, which serve as a valuable model for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying nephropathy and the interactions between these key biological entities.

74152825|a|This study investigates the molecular and genetic associations between sequence variants, gene products, and disease phenotypes in the context of neurological and retinal disorders. We focused on the sequence variant A-->G and its negative correlation with hemochromatosis, as well as its association with retinopathy of prematurity and the sequence variant G7958A. The variant G7958A was found to be associated with amnesia, while the variant A-->G showed a positive correlation with retinopathy of prematurity.   We examined the gene products chemokines, precore, and Vps2 in various cell lines, including Hs578T, HK2, and MC3T3-E1. The gene product precore was found to be associated with chemokines and Vps2, with a positive correlation between precore and retinopathy of prematurity. Additionally, precore showed a positive correlation with OIR and a negative correlation with amnesia. The gene product Vps2 was associated with OIR and showed a negative correlation with amnesia.   The gene product chemokines was found to be associated with precore and retinopathy of prematurity, with a positive correlation between chemokines and retinopathy of prematurity. Furthermore, chemokines showed a positive correlation with hemochromatosis. The disease phenotypes OIR and retinopathy of prematurity were both associated with precore, and OIR showed a positive correlation with Vps2.   The study also revealed that the sequence variant A-->G was negatively correlated with hemochromatosis and positively correlated with retinopathy of prematurity. The sequence variant G7958A was associated with amnesia. These findings suggest complex interactions between genetic variants, gene products, and disease phenotypes, particularly in the context of neurological and retinal pathologies. The results highlight the importance of understanding these molecular relationships for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

81000907|t|Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase, 253JB-V, and Insulin: interactions in the context of actinic keratosis
81000907|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase, 253JB-V cell lines, and Insulin in the context of actinic keratosis and MFA. Using a combination of biochemical assays and molecular profiling, we demonstrate a positive correlation between Insulin and thrombocytopenia, as well as a positive correlation between thrombocytopenia and Insulin. These findings suggest a potential regulatory role of Insulin in platelet function under pathological conditions. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between Sox4 and Insulin, as well as between Sox4 and MFA, indicating a possible functional link between these molecular entities in disease progression.   Our analysis also reveals a significant association between MFA and Sox4, further supporting the hypothesis that Sox4 may serve as a key mediator in the pathogenesis of MFA. In parallel, we compare the effects of anthracyclines and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid on cellular responses in COS-7 and HEK293 cell lines, highlighting distinct mechanisms of action. Notably, the study includes data from rhesus monkeys and ginseng, suggesting potential translational relevance across species and plant-based compounds.   The findings underscore the importance of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase and 253JB-V in modulating Insulin signaling, with implications for the treatment of actinic keratosis and related conditions. The repeated presence of Palmitate in our experimental models further supports its role in lipid-mediated regulation of these pathways. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular underpinnings of these complex interactions.

67038511|t|Epo, iron, and genetic variants in HeLa and RAW 264.7 cells: interactions with cerulenin and tobacco-derived
67038511|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the erythropoietin (Epo) gene, iron, and the sequence variant -889TT in the context of HeLa and RAW 264.7 cell lines, with a focus on the effects of cerulenin and tobacco exposure. The research highlights the role of Epo in modulating cellular responses to iron and cerulenin, as well as the influence of genetic variants on these interactions.   In HeLa cells, Epo expression was found to positively correlate with both iron and cerulenin levels, suggesting a potential regulatory role of Epo in iron homeostasis and cerulenin toxicity. Similarly, in RAW 264.7 cells, the positive correlation between Epo and iron was further supported by cotreatment experiments, where Epo and iron together enhanced cellular uptake of cerulenin.   The sequence variant -889TT exhibited a negative correlation with both cerulenin and iron, indicating that this genetic polymorphism may alter the cellular response to these agents. In particular, the negative correlation between -889TT and cerulenin was most pronounced in tobacco-exposed cells, suggesting a possible interaction between tobacco-derived factors and the genetic variant.   Cotreatment of HeLa and RAW 264.7 cells with iron and cerulenin revealed a synergistic effect, with increased cytotoxicity observed in both cell lines. This effect was further modulated by the presence of the -889TT variant, which reduced the cytotoxic impact of cerulenin in the presence of iron.   The study also explored the impact of tobacco exposure on these interactions, finding that tobacco-derived compounds enhanced the negative correlation between -889TT and iron, while also amplifying the positive correlation between Epo and cerulenin. These findings suggest that the interplay between genetic variants, environmental factors, and chemical entities plays a critical role in determining cellular responses to Epo, iron, and cerulenin in both HeLa and RAW 264.7 cell lines.

46460826|t|Evaluation of Spirulina supplementation in guinea pigs and its impact on left ventricular hypertrophy and GI AEs in Ba/F3 and 253JB-V ce
46460826|a|This study investigates the effects of Spirulina supplementation on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal outcomes in guinea pigs and its potential influence on the behavior of Ba/F3, 253JB-V, and MH134 cell lines. Guinea pigs were divided into groups receiving either Spirulina or a control diet, and their cardiac and gastrointestinal health was monitored over a 12-week period. The incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was significantly higher in the control group compared to the Spirulina-treated group. Additionally, gastrointestinal adverse events (GI AEs) were observed in both groups, but the severity was reduced in the Spirulina group. To further explore the molecular mechanisms, the effects of Spirulina on Ba/F3, 253JB-V, and MH134 cell lines were evaluated in vitro. The results showed that Spirulina treatment modulated the proliferation and survival of these cell lines, suggesting potential therapeutic applications in cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders. The findings highlight the protective role of Spirulina in preventing left ventricular hypertrophy and reducing GI AEs, while also influencing the behavior of key cell lines involved in disease progression.

41970654|t|IR and host cell factor 1 interactions modulated by Re, Rg1, Rb1 ginsenosides and malonic acid in Kilham rat virus-infected sheep and Spirulina-expose
41970654|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the gene product IR, host cell factor 1, and the chemical entities Re, Rg1, Rb1 ginsenosides, and malonic acid in the context of Kilham rat virus infection in sheep and Spirulina exposure. The research highlights a positive correlation between Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides and malonic acid, as well as a comparison between these two chemical entities. Additionally, the study reveals a negative correlation between Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides and both IR and host cell factor 1, while malonic acid shows a negative correlation with both IR and host cell factor 1. These findings suggest that the metabolic and regulatory effects of these chemical entities may play a significant role in modulating the expression and function of IR and host cell factor 1 in the presence of Kilham rat virus and Spirulina. The results are further supported by in vivo experiments conducted on sheep and Spirulina-exposed models, which demonstrate the dynamic interplay between these molecular components in different biological contexts. The study underscores the potential therapeutic applications of Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides in managing conditions associated with IR and host cell factor 1 dysregulation, particularly in viral and microbial infection models.

97972130|a|This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological interactions between the sequence variant rs2622604 and the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase in the context of cotreatment with glimepiride, glipizide, Arsenic, and contrast. The sequence variant rs2622604 was found to modulate the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, which plays a critical role in vascular function and inflammation. The study further explores how the presence of rs2622604 influences the pharmacological response to glimepiride, glipizide, Arsenic, and contrast.   Cotreatment with contrast and glimepiride was associated with a significant alteration in the expression levels of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed vascular effects. Similarly, cotreatment with contrast and Arsenic led to a synergistic effect on the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, which may contribute to the toxicological profile of these agents. Cotreatment with contrast and glipizide also showed a notable impact on the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, indicating a possible interaction between these drugs.  The cotreatment of Arsenic and glimepiride was found to significantly alter the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, which may have implications for the management of diabetes and vascular complications. Additionally, cotreatment of Arsenic and glipizide was associated with a marked change in the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, suggesting a potential therapeutic or toxicological interaction. Cotreatment of glimepiride and Arsenic also showed a significant effect on the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, which may be relevant in the context of drug-induced toxicity.  The study also examined the role of the gene product actin and the gene EGF in these interactions. The expression of actin was found to be modulated by the presence of rs2622604, and the expression of EGF was significantly altered in response to cotreatment with glimepiride, glipizide, Arsenic, and contrast. These findings suggest that the genetic variant rs2622604 may serve as a biomarker for predicting the response to these drugs and for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying their interactions.  In conclusion, the study provides evidence for the complex interactions between rs2622604, the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, and the cotreatment of glimepiride, glipizide, Arsenic, and contrast. These findings have important implications for personalized medicine and the development of safer therapeutic strategies.

22583963|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between clathrin, beta-dystroglycan, and various sequence variants in the context of disease mechanisms. We demonstrate that the sequence variant arginine 555-to-tryptophan exhibits a positive correlation with Antioxidant levels, suggesting a potential protective role in cellular stress responses. Additionally, the sequence variant p.V657_G726 is found to be associated with multiple gene products, including collagen SH and PI3K, highlighting its broad functional impact.   The chemical entity HGA shows a significant association with corticosteroid, indicating a possible role in inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, the sequence variant C111G is linked to Antioxidant levels, reinforcing the importance of antioxidant regulation in disease contexts. Notably, the sequence variant G12D is found to be negatively correlated with Stat5, suggesting a potential disruption in signaling pathways critical for cellular function.   Our findings also reveal a negative correlation between Stat5 and clathrin, implying a regulatory relationship that may influence cellular processes such as endocytosis. The gene product creatine kinase is negatively correlated with Antioxidant levels, suggesting a possible antagonistic relationship in metabolic regulation.   The sequence variant dup24bp is positively correlated with naproxen, indicating a potential pharmacological interaction that warrants further investigation. The chemical entity ferric is associated with multiple gene products, including gpIbalpha and acetylcholinesterase, suggesting a role in redox homeostasis and neurotransmission.   Finally, the chemical entity Antioxidant is found to be associated with multiple sequence variants, including p.A365E and C111G, underscoring its central role in modulating genetic variability and disease outcomes. These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions.

53316300|t|Genetic Variants and Disease Associations in Diverse Models: Insights from Cell Lines, Organisms, and Phenotypic 
53316300|a|This study explores the complex interplay between genetic variants, disease phenotypes, and biological models across multiple species and cell lines. We investigated the associations between specific sequence variants and a range of diseases, including dementia, non-melanoma skin cancers, uterine sarcoma, inherited bleeding disorder, cleft lip, and hemochromatosis. The study also examined the relationships between these genetic variants and various organisms, including Drosophila, Platonia insignis Mart, West Nile virus, and tobacco.   Key findings include a negative correlation between the deletion (TGAG) and dementia, as well as a positive correlation between deletion (TGAG) and non-melanoma skin cancers. The sequence variant p.Ser119fsX was found to be associated with dementia, non-melanoma skin cancers, and inherited bleeding disorder, with a positive correlation between p.Ser119fsX and both dementia and inherited bleeding disorder. Additionally, p.Ser119fsX showed a negative correlation with hemochromatosis and a positive correlation with uterine sarcoma and cleft lip.   The deletion (TGAG) was also associated with hemochromatosis, uterine sarcoma, and inherited bleeding disorder, with a positive correlation between deletion (TGAG) and hemochromatosis, uterine sarcoma, and dementia. Notably, there was a negative correlation between deletion (TGAG) and non-melanoma skin cancers, and a negative correlation between p.Ser119fsX and dementia.   The study utilized a variety of cell lines, including C57BL/6J, KU7, H9c2, H446, GT1-1, and COS-7, to model these genetic associations. The results highlight the importance of genetic variants in disease pathogenesis and suggest potential therapeutic targets for conditions such as dementia, non-melanoma skin cancers, and inherited bleeding disorders. The findings also underscore the value of using diverse biological models, including Drosophila and West Nile virus, to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases.

04927478|t|Thapsigargin and Raloxifene Hydrochloride: Multifaceted Associations with Cardiogenic Shock, NSARD, and Calcification of Ascending Aorta in Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Platonia Insig
04927478|a|This study explores the complex interactions between thapsigargin, raloxifene hydrochloride, and various disease states in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Platonia insignis Mart. We investigate the association between thapsigargin and MR, demonstrating a positive correlation that suggests a potential role in modulating myocardial function. Additionally, we find a positive correlation between raloxifene hydrochloride and calcification of ascending aorta, indicating a possible protective effect against aortic calcification.   The conversion between tamoxifen and thapsigargin is highlighted, with evidence suggesting that tamoxifen can be metabolized into thapsigargin, which in turn exhibits a positive correlation with MR. Furthermore, the conversion between tamoxifen and raloxifene hydrochloride is supported, indicating a potential pharmacological pathway for these two compounds.   We also report a positive correlation between thapsigargin and resting tremor, suggesting a possible involvement in neurodegenerative processes. The association between cardiogenic shock and thapsigargin is further reinforced, with thapsigargin showing a direct link to this severe cardiovascular condition. Similarly, cardiogenic shock is associated with raloxifene hydrochloride, indicating a potential therapeutic role in managing this condition.   The association between NSARD and raloxifene hydrochloride is explored, with evidence suggesting that raloxifene hydrochloride may have anti-inflammatory properties that benefit patients with NSARD. Additionally, oligodontia is found to be associated with raloxifene hydrochloride, suggesting a possible role in dental development.   The study also includes multiple instances of calcification of ascending aorta, which is associated with tamoxifen, indicating a potential link between this condition and the use of tamoxifen. Resting tremor is further associated with thapsigargin, reinforcing the complex interplay between these compounds and neurological manifestations.   The presence of human immunodeficiency virus and Platonia insignis Mart in the study population adds a unique dimension to the investigation, as these organisms are linked to various disease states and may influence the pharmacological responses observed. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the multifaceted relationships between chemical entities and disease phenotypes in both human and plant systems.

26149509|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between crack cocaine, sevoflurane, and L-365,260 in modulating the activity of Jnk and Src signaling pathways across multiple species, including rats, rhesus monkeys, and Mangifera indica Linn. The research reveals a negative correlation between crack cocaine and Jnk, as well as a negative correlation between Jnk and Src. These findings are further supported by the association between Jnk and crack cocaine, and the positive correlation between sevoflurane and Jnk. Additionally, the study demonstrates a positive correlation between sevoflurane and L-365,260, as well as a positive correlation between L-365,260 and crack cocaine.   The data also show a positive correlation between sevoflurane and LY294002, and a positive correlation between LY294002 and Jnk. Notably, there is a negative correlation between Src and LY294002, and an association between Src and crack cocaine. The study further reports a conversion between LY294002 and crack cocaine, as well as a conversion between crack cocaine and sevoflurane. These interactions are examined in various cell lines, including MEF, MES-SA/Dx5, SNU-C5, and GT1-1, with the latter being the most frequently used in the experiments.   The findings suggest that these chemical entities and signaling molecules play a critical role in modulating cellular responses in both rodents and non-human primates. The study also highlights the importance of these interactions in the context of different species, including horses and Mangifera indica Linn, which were included to assess the broader biological relevance of these findings. Overall, the results provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these compounds on key signaling pathways.

44912058|t|Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: Genetic and Pharmacological Insights into the Role of TP53, PGE2, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, and Ris
44912058|a|Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains a significant clinical challenge following surgical procedures. This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological factors influencing PONV, with a focus on the interplay between sequence variants, gene products, and chemical entities. We analyzed the association between the sequence variant (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 and PONV, finding a negative correlation between this variant and the occurrence of PONV. Similarly, the sequence variant rs12910509 showed a negative correlation with PONV, suggesting a potential protective role in reducing the incidence of this adverse event.   The gene TP53 was found to have a negative correlation with PONV, indicating that variations in TP53 expression or function may contribute to the prevention of PONV. Additionally, the gene product PGE2 exhibited a negative correlation with PONV, suggesting that reduced levels of PGE2 may be associated with a lower risk of developing PONV. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) also showed a negative correlation with PONV, implying that EGFR signaling pathways may play a role in modulating the risk of PONV.  Pharmacologically, risperidone was found to have a negative correlation with PONV, suggesting that its use may help in the management of PONV. The study further explored the interactions between these genetic and pharmacological factors, highlighting the complex regulatory networks that influence PONV. These findings provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of PONV in postoperative patients.

50198296|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying lower extremity weakness and the potential roles of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and POSTN in this condition. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we examined the expression and functional interactions of IL-6 and POSTN in various cell lines, including KU7, MEF, and HEK293. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between IL-6 and POSTN, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship between these two genes. Furthermore, we observed an association between both IL-6 and POSTN with lower extremity weakness, indicating their possible involvement in the pathophysiology of this phenotypic feature. The study also explores the influence of Mangifera indica Linn and mouse mammary tumor virus on the expression of these genes in different cellular contexts. These results provide new insights into the complex interplay between cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins, and neurological phenotypes, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

00687566|t|Genetic Variants of MMP-9 and SOX10 in Postprandial Dyspepsia: A Study Using the MES-SA/Dx5 C
00687566|a|Postprandial dyspepsia is a common gastrointestinal disorder with complex genetic and environmental determinants. This study investigates the association between genetic variants of MMP-9 and SOX10 and the development of postprandial dyspepsia using the MES-SA/Dx5 cell line as a model system. We found a significant positive correlation between postprandial dyspepsia and both MMP-9 and SOX10, suggesting a potential role for these genes in the pathophysiology of the condition.   The sequence variant A118D was strongly associated with increased expression of MMP-9 in the MES-SA/Dx5 cell line, while rs6232 showed a significant association with both MMP-9 and SOX10. These findings support the hypothesis that genetic variability in these genes may contribute to the susceptibility to postprandial dyspepsia. Additionally, the A118D variant was also found to be associated with SOX10, further highlighting the complex interplay between these genes in the context of this disease.   Our results indicate that MMP-9 and SOX10 are key players in the development of postprandial dyspepsia, with multiple sequence variants contributing to their expression and function. The MES-SA/Dx5 cell line proved to be a valuable tool for studying these associations, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition. These findings may have important implications for the development of targeted therapies for postprandial dyspepsia.

32183207|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Kilham rat virus (KRV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) with various cell lines, including C57BL/6, Mz-ChA-1, and 253JB-V, in the context of canine and rhesus monkey models. The research focuses on the differential susceptibility of these cell lines to viral infection and the subsequent impact on cellular pathways associated with viral replication and immune response. Notably, the study reveals that C57BL/6 and Mz-ChA-1 cell lines exhibit distinct patterns of viral entry and replication when exposed to KRV and MMTV, suggesting a role for host genetic factors in determining viral tropism. Additionally, the study explores the influence of canine and rhesus monkey models on viral pathogenesis, with particular emphasis on the role of C57BL/6J and BALB/c cell lines in modulating immune responses. The findings also highlight the importance of 253JB-V cell lines in understanding the interplay between viral infection and host cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, the study includes an analysis of the effects of Escherichia coli and C. elegans on viral replication, providing insights into the broader ecological and immunological context of viral infections. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between viruses and host cells, with implications for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccine strategies.

91360445|t|Caspase-3 and PrlR Interactions in Rabbit Models of Cardiovascular, Craniofacial, and Thymic Malformations and Asparagine
91360445|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations in rabbits, with a focus on the interplay between caspase-3, PrlR, and sequence variants such as single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide and p.A365E. We observed a negative correlation between caspase-3 and PrlR, suggesting that their expression levels are inversely related. Additionally, a bind relationship was identified between caspase-3 and PrlR, indicating a potential functional interaction.   The study also revealed a positive correlation between cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations and both the single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide and p.A365E. However, a negative correlation was found between the single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide and cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, suggesting a complex regulatory network. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between p.A365E and cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, indicating a possible antagonistic effect.  In the context of asparagine deficit, a positive correlation was found between asparagine deficit and the single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide, while a negative correlation was noted between p.A365E and asparagine deficit. These findings suggest that the sequence variants may influence asparagine metabolism in distinct ways. The study was conducted in rabbit models, which provided a robust platform for examining these genetic and phenotypic associations. Overall, the results highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants, gene products, and phenotypic outcomes in the context of developmental disorders.

26136830|t|Procaine, ACh, and Genetic Variants in Neurological and Metabolic Disorders: A Multifactorial 
26136830|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between chemical entities, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes in neurological and metabolic disorders. We report a positive correlation between procaine and hyperglycemia, suggesting a potential pharmacological interaction that warrants further investigation. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between ACh and hyperglycemia, which may indicate a shared regulatory pathway in glucose metabolism.   ACh also shows a positive correlation with microcornea and ALL, suggesting a possible role in developmental processes and immune function. The sequence variant p.Ala204Asp is positively correlated with ACh, indicating a potential functional relationship that could influence cholinergic signaling. Furthermore, the sequence variant rs1441817 is positively correlated with procaine, highlighting a genetic basis for drug response variability.  Dexamethasone is positively correlated with ADHD and microcornea, and it also shows an association with yohimbine. This association between Dexamethasone and yohimbine is further supported by a positive correlation between yohimbine and hypothermic, as well as a positive correlation between yohimbine and ALL. These findings suggest a potential pharmacological synergy or shared mechanism between these compounds in modulating neurodevelopmental and metabolic pathways.  Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents are positively correlated with both rs25487 and ADHD, and they are also associated with ACh. This association between nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and ACh may provide insights into the role of inflammation in cholinergic signaling. Additionally, Dexamethasone is positively correlated with microcornea, reinforcing its potential involvement in ocular development.  The sequence variant rs25487 is positively correlated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, and the sequence variant -134delA is also present in the dataset, though its functional role remains to be elucidated. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between chemical entities, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes, offering new directions for research in personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics.

05479189|a|This study investigates the genetic and pharmacological interactions of the sequence variant rs861019 with doxycycline, Vitamin C, and the disease feature GE across multiple cell lines, including Ba/F3, PC-3, and SMMC-7721. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between rs861019 and doxycycline, as well as a strong association between rs861019 and Vitamin C. Additionally, we observed a significant positive correlation between rs861019 and GE, suggesting a potential regulatory role of this variant in disease progression. The association between GE and doxycycline further supports the hypothesis that doxycycline may modulate GE-related pathways. Notably, the positive correlation between rs861019 and FU indicates a possible synergistic effect of this variant with the chemical entity FU. Furthermore, the association between GE and FU suggests that these two factors may act in concert to influence disease outcomes. These results were consistently observed across multiple cell lines, including Ba/F3, PC-3, and SMMC-7721, highlighting the broad relevance of these interactions in cellular and disease contexts. The repeated presence of doxycycline and Vitamin C in our analyses underscores their potential as therapeutic agents in modulating the effects of rs861019 and GE. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease features in cellular systems.

07724535|t|Interactions and associations between HCTZ, disulfiram, camptothecin, and their effects on bacteria, guinea-pigs, Mangifera indica Linn, and Daucu
07724535|a|This study investigates the complex interactions and associations between the diuretic drug HCTZ, the antifungal agent disulfiram, and the chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin, with a focus on their effects on bacterial growth, guinea-pig physiology, and plant species such as Mangifera indica Linn and Daucus carota. HCTZ was found to interact with disulfiram, resulting in a negative correlation between their pharmacological effects, which may be attributed to competitive inhibition at the renal tubular level. The association between HCTZ and disulfiram was further supported by in vitro experiments showing reduced efficacy of disulfiram in the presence of HCTZ. Additionally, the drug interaction between camptothecin and HCTZ was observed, with camptothecin demonstrating a negative correlation with HCTZ in terms of cellular uptake and DNA binding activity.   The study also explored the impact of these drugs on bacterial cultures, where HCTZ and disulfiram were found to synergistically inhibit the growth of several bacterial strains, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In guinea-pig models, HCTZ and disulfiram were associated with altered metabolic profiles, particularly in the liver and kidneys, suggesting potential toxicological interactions. Camptothecin, on the other hand, showed a negative correlation with HCTZ in terms of its antitumor activity in Daucus carota cell lines, indicating possible interference with the drug's mechanism of action.   Furthermore, the effects of these compounds on Mangifera indica Linn and Daucus carota were examined, revealing that HCTZ and disulfiram had significant associations with plant growth inhibition, while camptothecin exhibited a negative correlation with plant cell viability. These findings highlight the importance of understanding drug-drug interactions and their biological implications across different organisms and species, particularly in the context of pharmacological research and environmental toxicology.

56919738|t|IL-6 and IL-7 Interactions in HCT116 and SNU-C2A Cells: Genetic and Functional Insights from HIV and Dengue Virus Type 2 In
56919738|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the context of HIV and dengue virus type 2 infections. Using HCT116 and SNU-C2A cell lines, we demonstrate a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-7, as well as an association between IL-6 and IL-7. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between IL-7 and IL-6, which is counterbalanced by a positive correlation between IL-7 and IL-6, suggesting a dynamic regulatory network. The study also reveals a bind between IL-6 and IL-7, as well as an association between IL-7 and IL-6, further supporting their functional interplay.   A sequence variant, c.689C>G, is found to be associated with both IL-6 and IL-7, indicating a potential genetic influence on their expression and function. This variant is linked to IL-7 through an association, and also to IL-6 through another association, highlighting its role in modulating the IL-6/IL-7 axis. The study further explores the impact of HIV and dengue virus type 2 on these interactions, with multiple instances of HIV and dengue virus type 2 mentioned to emphasize their relevance in the context of immune response and cytokine regulation. The findings suggest that IL-6 and IL-7 are key players in the immune response to these pathogens, with their interactions being influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.

43813332|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of sulphonylurea, T3, and sequence variants in relation to chorea, Sudden infant death syndrome, and bovin
43813332|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and phenotypic outcomes in both human and animal models. This research focuses on the associations between the sequence variants rs1441817, c.474delA, 1858C/T, and -652 6N del with the disease phenotypes chorea and Sudden infant death syndrome, as well as their interactions with the chemical entities sulphonylurea and T3.   In a series of experiments involving the HK-2 cell line and bovine tissues, the sequence variant rs1441817 was found to be significantly associated with both chorea and Sudden infant death syndrome. Additionally, the variant c.474delA showed a strong association with sulphonylurea, suggesting a potential role in modulating the pharmacological response to this drug. The sequence variant 1858C/T was linked to sulphonylurea, while the variant -652 6N del was associated with both Sudden infant death syndrome and T3.   Notably, a negative correlation was observed between sulphonylurea and T3, indicating a possible antagonistic interaction between these two chemical entities. Furthermore, the drug interaction between sulphonylurea and T3 was confirmed through pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, highlighting the importance of monitoring their combined use in clinical settings.   The study also included the organism taxon Daucus carota and ginseng as part of a broader investigation into the effects of plant-derived compounds on the expression of these genetic variants. The findings suggest that the interplay between genetic factors and pharmacological agents plays a critical role in the manifestation of phenotypic outcomes such as chorea and Sudden infant death syndrome. These results provide a foundation for future research into personalized medicine approaches that consider both genetic and pharmacological profiles.

11233306|t|Genomic and functional analysis of Lin and SUFU in Platonia insignis Mart: associations with brain ischemic, Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3, and DFNB7/B11 
11233306|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional relationships between the gene Lin and the protein SUFU in the organism Platonia insignis Mart, with a focus on their associations with various disease phenotypes. We report a positive correlation between DFNB7/B11 deafness and cytosine insertion, as well as a positive correlation between DFNB7/B11 deafness and Lin. Additionally, DFNB7/B11 deafness is positively correlated with SNP 10510452_139 and V876E, and is associated with pegylated interferon.   The gene SUFU is associated with pegylated interferon and brain ischemic, and there is a positive correlation between brain ischemic and SUFU. SUFU also shows a positive correlation with brain ischemic and cytosine insertion, and is functionally linked to Lin through a bind relationship. Lin is associated with pegylated interferon and brain ischemic, and is also positively correlated with Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3. Furthermore, Lin is positively correlated with brain ischemic and with cytosine insertion.   The study also reveals a positive correlation between Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 and pegylated interferon, as well as a positive correlation between Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 and cytosine insertion. SUFU and Lin are functionally linked through a bind relationship, and SUFU is associated with Lin.   These findings suggest that Lin and SUFU play significant roles in the pathogenesis of brain ischemic, Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3, and DFNB7/B11 deafness in Platonia insignis Mart, with multiple sequence variants and chemical entities contributing to these associations. The results highlight the complex interplay between genetic factors and disease phenotypes in this organism.

77111220|t|S6K1 and GLP1R interactions in ginseng and Platonia insignis Mart: implications for mirtazapine and dexamphetamine s
77111220|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between gene products and chemical entities in various organisms, particularly in the context of neuropharmacology and metabolic regulation. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between dexamphetamine and CPT1 in Escherichia coli, as well as the interaction between endothelial NO synthase and both dexamphetamine and 6-OHDA. Additionally, the study investigates the relationship between S6K1 and mirtazapine in the context of ginseng and Platonia insignis Mart, revealing a significant association.   The findings suggest a negative correlation between CPT1 and mirtazapine, which may have implications for metabolic pathways in mouse mammary tumor virus-infected cells. Furthermore, the role of GLP1R in modulating the effects of dexamphetamine is examined, with evidence supporting its involvement in the regulation of ATP levels in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus contexts.   The study also explores the impact of mirtazapine on S6K1 activity in ginseng, with implications for the treatment of neurological disorders. Notably, the presence of multiple instances of the chemical entity E and the gene product endothelial NO synthase in the data set underscores the importance of these molecules in signaling pathways across different organisms, including Aedes mosquitoes and Spirulina.   These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular interactions between gene products and chemical entities in diverse biological systems, with potential applications in drug development and therapeutic strategies.

26716620|t|H9c2 cell line responses to organochloride exposure and the impact of the 144 G>A sequence variant on streptococcus infection suscep
26716620|a|The H9c2 cell line, a widely used model for cardiac myocyte studies, was exposed to varying concentrations of organochloride to investigate its effects on cellular function and gene expression. Results showed a positive correlation between organochloride exposure and the presence of the 144 G>A sequence variant in the H9c2 cell line, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to altered responses to this chemical entity. Further analysis revealed an association between organochloride and the 144 G>A variant, with higher expression levels of the variant observed under organochloride stress conditions.   To explore the broader implications of the 144 G>A variant, we examined its role in streptococcus infection susceptibility using the H9c2 cell line. The 144 G>A variant was found to be significantly associated with increased susceptibility to streptococcus infection, as evidenced by higher bacterial adherence and lower phagocytic activity in H9c2 cells carrying this variant. These findings were consistent across multiple independent experiments, with 17 instances of streptococcus infection reported in H9c2 cell cultures harboring the 144 G>A variant.   The study also demonstrated that the 144 G>A variant may modulate the cellular response to organochloride, potentially through altered transcriptional regulation of immune-related pathways. Given the high frequency of the 144 G>A variant in the H9c2 cell line (13 instances) and its strong association with both organochloride exposure and streptococcus infection, this variant may represent a key genetic factor in the interplay between environmental toxins and infectious disease susceptibility. These results highlight the importance of considering genetic variability in the context of environmental exposures and infectious disease outcomes.

42071956|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of sequence variants, reactive oxygen species, and disease in Drosophila and chic
42071956|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic sequence variants, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and disease mechanisms in both Drosophila and chick models. A key focus is the association between autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) and the sequence variant G/C, which was observed in multiple experimental conditions. The variant c.1151C>A was found to be genetically linked to P120T, and this relationship was further supported by the reciprocal association between P120T and c.1151C>A. These findings suggest a potential functional relationship between these sequence variants in the context of ADCA. Additionally, the variant P120T was shown to interact with the drug etoricoxib, indicating a possible pharmacological relevance in disease management. The study also explored the role of reactive oxygen species in modulating the effects of c.1151C>A and G/C, with evidence suggesting that these variants may influence ROS production in both Drosophila and chick models. Cyclosporin A and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine were used as pharmacological tools to modulate these interactions, with cyclosporin A showing a significant effect on the expression of G/C in bacterial cultures. The presence of multiple sequence variants, including P120T and c.1151C>A, was consistently observed across different experimental conditions, reinforcing their potential role in the pathogenesis of ADCA. The study also highlights the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in understanding the molecular basis of ADCA and its associated phenotypes. The findings provide a foundation for further research into the therapeutic targeting of these variants in both model organisms and human disease.

14471404|t|GSH, GH-binding protein, and mivacurium interactions in sheep models of left ventricular dysfunction and tooth 
14471404|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between glutathione (GSH), GH-binding protein, and mivacurium in sheep models of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and tooth agenesis. The research focuses on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying these associations, particularly in the context of cell lines such as SW480, KU7, H9c2, SMMC-7721, and 253JB-V.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between GSH and GH-binding protein, suggesting that increased levels of GSH may inhibit the activity of GH-binding protein. Conversely, a positive correlation is observed between left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and GSH, indicating that GSH may play a protective role in cardiac function. Additionally, a negative correlation is found between left ventricular dysfunction and mivacurium, implying that mivacurium may exacerbate cardiac dysfunction.   Tooth agenesis is significantly associated with both GH-binding protein and GSH, with a positive correlation between tooth agenesis and GH-binding protein and a negative correlation between tooth agenesis and GSH. Furthermore, mivacurium shows a complex relationship with tooth agenesis, exhibiting both positive and negative correlations, which may reflect its dual role in modulating cellular processes.   The study also highlights the role of cell lines such as SW480, KU7, H9c2, SMMC-7721, and 253JB-V in mediating these interactions, providing insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying the observed associations. These results contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between GSH, GH-binding protein, and mivacurium in the context of cardiac and dental pathologies in sheep models.

66380767|t|Protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3: genetic variants and their associations with IEC-6 cell line function and ex
66380767|a|Protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 (PDIAM3) plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of proteins through its isomerase activity. This study investigates the functional and expression consequences of specific sequence variants in PDIAM3, particularly in the context of the IEC-6 cell line, which is a well-characterized model for intestinal epithelial function.   We analyzed the impact of the sequence variant c.357-3C>G on PDIAM3 expression and activity in IEC-6 cells. This variant was found to significantly alter the splicing pattern of the PDIAM3 pre-mRNA, leading to a reduction in the levels of the full-length protein. Additionally, the variant was associated with a decrease in the enzymatic activity of PDIAM3, as measured by its ability to catalyze disulfide bond formation in recombinant proteins.   The sequence variant T3801C was also examined for its effect on PDIAM3 expression. This variant was shown to be linked to a subtle but consistent reduction in PDIAM3 protein levels in IEC-6 cells, which correlated with impaired cell viability under oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, the variant p.Thr26 was found to be a key determinant of PDIAM3's redox sensitivity, with the Thr26 residue playing a central role in the protein's ability to respond to changes in the cellular redox environment.   Our findings suggest that the sequence variants c.357-3C>G, T3801C, and p.Thr26 are functionally significant in modulating the expression and activity of PDIAM3 in IEC-6 cells. These results highlight the importance of genetic variability in PDIAM3 and its potential implications for cellular function and disease susceptibility.

80971043|t|Glucocorticoid resistance, Cortical dysplasia, and sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome: genetic and pharmacological insights using IEC-6 and LbetaT2 ce
80971043|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between glucocorticoid resistance, Cortical dysplasia, and sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome, with a focus on the genetic and pharmacological mechanisms underlying these conditions. Using the IEC-6 and LbetaT2 cell lines, we explored the effects of sequence variants and chemical entities on disease phenotypes. Our findings reveal a significant association between Cortical dysplasia and the sequence variant S429T, as well as between Cortical dysplasia and rs713041. Similarly, sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome is strongly linked to the sequence variants 1284A>C and rs713041, and also to I238M.   Glucocorticoid resistance is associated with multiple sequence variants, including S429T, rs713041, and I238M, as well as with the sequence variant 1284A>C. These associations suggest a potential role for these genetic variants in the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid resistance. Additionally, insomnia is found to be linked to S429T, rs713041, and I238M, highlighting a possible genetic basis for this condition.   The chemical entity Apomorphine shows a significant association with I238M, rs713041, and 1284A>C, indicating its potential involvement in modulating the expression or function of these genetic variants. Furthermore, the gene product GDF15 is found to be highly expressed in both IEC-6 and LbetaT2 cell lines, and its expression is modulated by the sequence variant 1284A>C. The gene product MEN1 is also implicated in the regulation of glucocorticoid resistance and is associated with the sequence variant 1284A>C.   The gene product Cidec is found to be upregulated in IEC-6 cells in response to Apomorphine, and the gene product Sp3 is associated with the sequence variant rs713041. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex diseases and highlight the potential of using cell lines like IEC-6 and LbetaT2 to study the genetic and pharmacological basis of glucocorticoid resistance, Cortical dysplasia, and sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome.

28324620|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in cancer cell lines and viral infections: insights from sequence variants and chemical 
28324620|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic sequence variants, chemical entities, and their effects on cancer cell lines and viral infections. We focused on the C57BL/6J cell line, which was used in multiple experiments to assess the impact of sequence variants such as c.1146+25insA and 457_458insG. The C57BL/6J cell line was also cotreated with polyalanine and extract of Daucus carota seeds, revealing a synergistic effect in modulating cellular responses.   The LNCaP cell line, which was used five times in the study, was found to exhibit a negative correlation between the adenine 474 deletion and MK-801 treatment. This suggests that the presence of the adenine 474 deletion may reduce the efficacy of MK-801 in this cell line. Similarly, the SNU-C2A cell line showed a negative correlation between the sequence variant c.1146+25insA and the extract of Daucus carota seeds, indicating a potential antagonistic interaction between these two factors.  The C4-2B and LbetaT2 cell lines were also included in the study, with the latter being used to examine the effects of taxol. The MCF7/AdrR cell line was used to assess the impact of the sequence variant rs713041, while the SF188 cell line was used to evaluate the effects of the M204V variant. The C57BL/6J cell line was used in five separate experiments, highlighting its importance in the study.  In addition to cancer cell lines, the study also examined the effects of HIV-1 and mouse mammary tumor virus on the expression of various sequence variants. The Aedes mosquitoes were included as a model organism to study the transmission dynamics of these viruses. The results suggest that the interaction between genetic variants and chemical entities plays a critical role in determining the biological outcomes in both cancer and viral contexts.

99169851|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of CEBPbeta, VCAM1, and sequence variants in AN, SCID, and glomerulos
99169851|a|This study investigates the complex genetic and pharmacological interactions between the transcription factor CEBPbeta, the adhesion molecule VCAM1, and various sequence variants in the context of autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and renal disorders. We report that the sequence variant M204I in CEBPbeta is positively correlated with increased expression of VCAM1, suggesting a potential regulatory role in immune cell adhesion and inflammation. Additionally, we find that the sequence variant -134delA in CEBPbeta is negatively correlated with VCAM1 expression, indicating a possible antagonistic relationship between these two molecules.   Our findings also reveal a positive correlation between the sequence variant M204I and the disease AN, highlighting its potential as a genetic risk factor for this condition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sequence variant -134delA is associated with the development of SCID, suggesting a critical role in immune system function. The chemical entity hexamethonium is found to be positively correlated with both VCAM1 and SCID, and its cotreatment with ristocetin is shown to modulate immune responses in experimental models.   We also report that the chemical entity cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors are positively correlated with hexamethonium and VCAM1, and that they are associated with increased VCAM1 expression. Notably, there is a negative correlation between CEBPbeta and cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, suggesting a potential regulatory interaction. The sequence variant M204I is also found to be positively correlated with the gene Vps2, which is associated with AN, further linking these genetic elements in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.   In addition, we observe that the sequence variant -134delA is associated with glomerulosclerosis, indicating a possible role in renal disease progression. The chemical entity ristocetin is found to be associated with CEBPbeta, and its cotreatment with hexamethonium is shown to enhance the effects of both agents in modulating immune responses. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in the context of autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders.

69028654|t|Genetic variant p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu and its associations with antipyretic use, leukemic progression, and skin lesions in human immunodeficiency virus and rhesus
69028654|a|This study investigates the genetic variant p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu and its potential associations with antipyretic use, leukemic progression, and skin lesions in both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and rhesus monkeys. The variant was identified in multiple studies involving human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and was found to be significantly correlated with antipyretic use in a cohort of patients with leukemic features. In addition, the variant showed a strong positive correlation with the development of leukemic conditions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. Furthermore, the variant was associated with the presence of skin lesions in both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and rhesus monkeys. The study also included multiple instances of the cell line SW480, which was used to model the effects of the variant in vitro. The results suggest that the sequence variant p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu may play a role in modulating the response to antipyretic drugs and in the progression of leukemic and skin-related conditions in both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and rhesus monkeys. These findings highlight the potential importance of this variant in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and their interactions with therapeutic agents.

08310300|t|West Nile virus and the molecular interplay of crumbs, Interferon regulatory factor 5, vimentin, and sequence variants c.2607C>A and c.1970_2177del in KU7 ce
08310300|a|West Nile virus (WNV) has been implicated in a range of neurological disorders, and its interaction with host cellular components is a critical area of investigation. This study explores the molecular mechanisms by which WNV modulates the expression and function of crumbs, Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), and vimentin in the KU7 cell line, with a focus on the sequence variants c.2607C>A and c.1970_2177del.   Our findings reveal that the sequence variant c.2607C>A is associated with both crumbs and IRF5, suggesting a potential regulatory role in their expression or function. Additionally, c.2607C>A is also linked to vimentin, indicating a broader impact on the cellular response to WNV. The variant c.1970_2177del is associated with IRF5, vimentin, and crumbs, further highlighting the complex interplay between these genetic elements and the virus.   Notably, there is a negative correlation between crumbs and vimentin, as well as between crumbs and IRF5, suggesting that these proteins may function in opposing pathways or regulatory networks. Similarly, a negative correlation is observed between IRF5 and vimentin, reinforcing the idea of a dynamic balance in the host response. The variant c.1970_2177del is also associated with c.2607C>A, indicating a potential functional relationship between these two sequence variants.   Furthermore, we observe that IRF5 binds to both crumbs and vimentin, while vimentin binds to crumbs, suggesting a direct interaction network involving these proteins. The negative correlation between IRF5 and crumbs, as well as between IRF5 and vimentin, underscores the complexity of the regulatory landscape in WNV-infected KU7 cells.   These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which WNV interacts with host factors, particularly in the context of the KU7 cell line. The associations and correlations identified here may serve as a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of WNV-related diseases and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

68597273|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between erythematous erysipelas, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the influence of 293T cell lines, tobacco, rat models, and Spirulina in modulating disease outcomes. The 293T cell line, widely used in molecular biology, was employed to model the inflammatory response associated with erythematous erysipelas. Our findings reveal that exposure to tobacco significantly exacerbates the severity of erythematous erysipelas, as evidenced by increased cytokine production and vascular permeability in 293T cells.   In parallel, we explored the role of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing surgical procedures, with a focus on the impact of 293T cell line-derived factors on gastrointestinal motility. The results indicate that 293T cell line-derived proteins may contribute to the pathophysiology of postoperative nausea and vomiting, particularly in individuals with a history of tobacco use.   To further understand the disease mechanisms, we utilized rat models and Spirulina as potential therapeutic agents. The rat model demonstrated that Spirulina supplementation reduced the incidence of erythematous erysipelas by modulating the immune response and decreasing oxidative stress. Additionally, Spirulina was found to mitigate the effects of postoperative nausea and vomiting in rat models, suggesting its potential as a complementary therapy.   Our study highlights the importance of 293T cell lines in elucidating the molecular pathways underlying erythematous erysipelas and postoperative nausea and vomiting. The findings also underscore the role of tobacco and Spirulina in disease progression and recovery, offering new insights into the development of targeted interventions. The repeated use of 293T cell lines, tobacco, rat models, and Spirulina in this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the multifactorial nature of these conditions.

76461972|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between homogentisic acid, T-cell receptor, and sequence variants in Murine models, with a focus on the regulation of pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide and CD36. We demonstrate a positive correlation between homogentisic acid and pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide, suggesting a potential role for homogentisic acid in modulating the expression or activity of this gene. Additionally, we observe a significant association between TAK1 and ADRB3, which may be linked to the regulation of CD36. The study also reveals a positive correlation between SH and HeLa E-box binding protein, as well as between SH and TAK1, indicating a potential signaling pathway involving these molecules. Furthermore, we find an association between ADRB3 and HeLa E-box binding protein, and between CD36 and ADRB3, highlighting the interconnectedness of these pathways. The research was conducted in Murine models, with additional analysis in mouse mammary tumor virus and HPV systems. Sequence variants such as 1469T->G, rs2073162, and p.F366L were identified, along with the 15 kb deletion, rs2622604, and cyclic AMP. Methoctramine was used as a pharmacological tool to modulate these interactions. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of these genes and their potential roles in disease.

08599787|t|Sequence variants in thrombin receptor and TGF-betaRI: associations with developmental defects, juvenile open angle glaucoma, and Kilham rat virus infection in Mice and Aedes mo
08599787|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between sequence variants in the thrombin receptor and TGF-betaRI, with implications for developmental defects, juvenile open angle glaucoma, and viral pathogenesis. A key finding is the association between the sequence variant p.D815A and the thrombin receptor, which was further supported by its positive correlation with TGF-betaRI. Similarly, the sequence variant p.Ser119fsX was found to be associated with both the thrombin receptor and TGF-betaRI, highlighting a potential functional link between these two proteins.   The Ile/Val polymorphism in the thrombin receptor was also found to be associated with both the thrombin receptor and TGF-betaRI, suggesting a broader role for this variant in modulating receptor function. Notably, the thrombin receptor was associated with developmental defects and juvenile open angle glaucoma, with the latter being directly linked to TGF-betaRI. This association was further reinforced by the positive correlation between TGF-betaRI and thrombin receptor, indicating a potential regulatory relationship between these two proteins.  In addition to these associations, the TGF-betaRI was found to be linked to developmental defects, reinforcing its role in developmental pathways. The study also explored the role of Kilham rat virus in these associations, particularly in Mice, where the virus was found to influence the expression of both the thrombin receptor and TGF-betaRI. Aedes mosquitoes were also implicated in the spread of these genetic associations, suggesting a possible environmental component to the observed phenotypes. These findings underscore the importance of sequence variants in the thrombin receptor and TGF-betaRI in the pathogenesis of developmental defects and juvenile open angle glaucoma, with potential implications for viral infections in both Mice and Aedes mosquitoes.

34220188|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between Escherichia coli and various molecular entities, including O2-, lactate dehydrogenase A, guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, C-peptide, and TPO. This research explores the multifaceted relationships among these components in the context of bacterial physiology and host-pathogen interactions.   Escherichia coli, a common Gram-negative bacterium, has been shown to interact with O2- in multiple cellular processes, including oxidative stress response and energy metabolism. The association between lactate dehydrogenase A and TPO was observed in several experimental models, suggesting a potential regulatory role of TPO in lactate dehydrogenase A activity. Additionally, lactate dehydrogenase A was found to bind O2-, indicating a direct interaction that may influence metabolic pathways under hypoxic conditions.  The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor was also found to bind O2-, suggesting a possible role in signal transduction pathways involving reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the association between lactate dehydrogenase A and guanine-nucleotide exchange factor was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, indicating a functional link between these two proteins.  C-peptide, a byproduct of insulin processing, was shown to bind O2- in a dose-dependent manner, potentially modulating its biological activity. The presence of multiple Escherichia coli strains and the repeated observation of O2- interactions with various molecular entities underscore the importance of reactive oxygen species in bacterial adaptation and host response.   These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Escherichia coli's interactions with host cells and the role of O2- in modulating key metabolic and signaling pathways. The repeated occurrence of these interactions across multiple experimental conditions supports the hypothesis that O2- serves as a critical mediator in the complex network of molecular relationships involving lactate dehydrogenase A, guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, C-peptide, and TPO.

81720470|t|ERK-1/2 signaling and T2734C variant in horses: implications for language delay and cellular responses in hRPT
81720470|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in modulating neural development and synaptic plasticity, which are essential for language acquisition. In horses, a significant association has been observed between the T2734C sequence variant and altered ERK-1/2 activity, suggesting a potential genetic mechanism underlying language delay in equine models. This finding is further supported by the presence of the T2734C variant in multiple horses exhibiting language delay, which correlates with reduced ERK-1/2 phosphorylation levels.   The hRPTEC cell line, derived from renal epithelial tissue, has been used to investigate the molecular pathways linking ERK-1/2 signaling to language delay. In these cells, the T2734C variant was found to be associated with a decrease in ERK-1/2 activation, which may reflect a broader mechanism of impaired neural signaling. Notably, the association between language delay and ERK-1/2 activity was confirmed in multiple independent studies, with a negative correlation observed in horses carrying the T2734C variant. This negative correlation suggests that increased ERK-1/2 activity may be protective against language delay, while reduced activity is linked to its occurrence.  Further analysis of the T2734C variant in horses revealed a consistent association with ERK-1/2 signaling, with the variant being present in 5 out of 8 horses with language delay. In contrast, the variant was absent in 3 horses without language delay, reinforcing the link between the T2734C sequence variant and ERK-1/2 function. These findings provide strong evidence for the role of ERK-1/2 in the pathogenesis of language delay and highlight the importance of genetic variants like T2734C in modulating this pathway. The hRPTEC cell line has also been used to demonstrate that the T2734C variant leads to a reduction in ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, which may contribute to the observed phenotypic effects in horses. Overall, these studies underscore the complex interplay between genetic variants, signaling pathways, and phenotypic outcomes in horses.

96340093|t|Apolipoprotein E and CHL2 Interactions in the Context of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, Developmental Delay, and Ventricular Tachycardia: A Multifactorial Analysis Involving Ponatinib and 5-Hydroxyindoleace
96340093|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between apolipoprotein E, CHL2, and various chemical entities in the context of multiple diseases and phenotypic features, including benign prostatic hyperplasia, developmental delay, and ventricular tachycardia. The research highlights the multifaceted roles of apolipoprotein E and CHL2 in modulating disease progression and response to therapeutic agents such as ponatinib and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.   Apolipoprotein E was found to exhibit a negative correlation with both doxycycline and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, suggesting a potential inhibitory effect of these compounds on apolipoprotein E activity. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between apolipoprotein E and ponatinib, indicating that ponatinib may enhance apolipoprotein E expression or function. Additionally, a positive correlation was noted between doxycycline and apolipoprotein E, suggesting a possible synergistic relationship between these two entities.   CHL2 showed a positive correlation with ponatinib, while a negative correlation was observed between CHL2 and doxycycline, indicating that these two chemical entities may have opposing effects on CHL2 expression or activity. Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between CHL2 and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship. Importantly, a bind was identified between apolipoprotein E and CHL2, highlighting a direct molecular interaction that may play a critical role in disease mechanisms.   The study also revealed that apolipoprotein E and CHL2 are significantly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, developmental delay, and ventricular tachycardia, with apolipoprotein E showing a stronger association with developmental delay and ventricular tachycardia. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay between these molecular entities in the context of complex diseases and their potential as therapeutic targets. The results provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions and the development of targeted interventions.

37949192|t|Regulation of Mg+2 ATPase and C2 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells: interactions with prednisolone, ibrutinib, and MHC class 
37949192|a|Recent studies have explored the complex regulatory networks involving Mg+2 ATPase, C2, and MHC class I and II in various cell lines, including LNCaP and PC-3. In LNCaP cells, Mg+2 ATPase levels were found to be negatively correlated with prednisolone treatment, suggesting a potential inhibitory effect of prednisolone on Mg+2 ATPase activity. Similarly, ibrutinib was shown to have a negative correlation with Mg+2 ATPase, indicating that ibrutinib may interfere with the function of this enzyme. These findings were further supported by experiments in PC-3 cells, where both prednisolone and ibrutinib consistently reduced Mg+2 ATPase expression.   In contrast, C2 exhibited a positive correlation with prednisolone, suggesting that prednisolone may enhance the expression or activity of C2. This relationship was observed in both LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines, as well as in MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Additionally, epsinR was found to have a positive correlation with MHC class I and II, indicating a potential role for epsinR in the regulation of these immune-related proteins. This was further supported by the positive correlation between MHC class I and II and C2, suggesting a coordinated regulatory mechanism involving these three gene products.  The study also included experiments using Aedes mosquitoes to assess the impact of Mg+2 ATPase and prednisolone on cellular processes in non-mammalian systems. These findings highlight the importance of Mg+2 ATPase, C2, and MHC class I and II in cellular signaling and immune responses, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways in both human and vector biology.

42819038|t|Adrenaline Modulation of HEB and YWHAZ in the Context of Mucolipidosis III Gamma and Left Ventricular Hyp
42819038|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between adrenaline signaling, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes in the context of mucolipidosis III gamma and left ventricular hypertrophy. We demonstrate a significant positive correlation between mucolipidosis III gamma and the sequence variant Arg124Leu, as well as between mucolipidosis III gamma and the insertion variant c.14_15insC. These findings suggest that these genetic alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of mucolipidosis III gamma through altered protein function and structural stability.   Further, we observe a negative correlation between left ventricular hypertrophy and the gene product HEB, indicating that HEB may act as a protective factor against the development of this cardiac condition. Our data also highlight the involvement of YWHAZ in the regulation of cellular responses to adrenaline, with two distinct instances of YWHAZ expression observed in different experimental conditions.   Additionally, we find that the p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is modulated by adrenaline, and this modulation is influenced by the presence of the HEB gene product. The study underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between adrenaline, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes, particularly in the context of mucolipidosis III gamma and left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings provide a foundation for future research into targeted therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

The cell line MES-SA/Dx5 was used as a model system to explore the effects of cortisol on Star-PAP expression, revealing a significant association between cortisol and Star-PAP. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between Star-PAP and GDF15, suggesting that Star-PAP may act as a regulatory factor in the expression of GDF15. The cell line GT1-1 was also employed to examine the role of Star-PAP in the progression of carcinogenesis, with results indicating a positive correlation between carcinogenesis and cortisol levels. Additionally, the presence of cortisol was found to modulate the expression of Star-PAP in a manner that may influence the development of cancerous phenotypes. The guinea-pigs used in this study were exposed to varying concentrations of cortisol, and the effects on Star-PAP and GDF15 were monitored over time. Our findings suggest that the relationship between Star-PAP, GDF15, and cortisol is complex and may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis. The results also highlight the importance of considering the interactions between these molecular entities in the context of disease progression. The cell line MES-SA/Dx5 was used in multiple experiments to validate the observed correlations, while the cell line GT1-1 provided additional insights into the cellular mechanisms involved. The data from this study provide a foundation for further research into the role of Star-PAP and GDF15 in the context of carcinogenesis and their potential as therapeutic targets.

73028000|t|Alendronate Sodium and Its Interactions with H-Ras, FGF Receptor 2, and Glucocorticoid Receptor-Interacting Protein 1 in Human Papilloma Virus and Zebrafis
73028000|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between alendronate sodium, H-Ras, and glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) in both human and zebrafish systems. Alendronate sodium, a bisphosphonate drug, has been shown to exhibit a positive correlation with H-Ras activity, suggesting a potential role in modulating cellular signaling pathways. This correlation is further supported by the binding interactions between H-Ras and GRIP1, which are critical for the regulation of downstream signaling cascades.   In addition, GRIP1 has been found to have a negative correlation with alendronate sodium, indicating a possible antagonistic relationship. This negative correlation is further reinforced by the binding of GRIP1 to IRF3, a key transcription factor involved in immune responses. The interaction between GRIP1 and IRF3 is also supported by the binding of Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to both IRF3 and H-Ras, highlighting the interconnected nature of these molecular pathways.  FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) has been shown to bind to COMT, and this interaction is associated with a negative correlation between FGFR2 and alendronate sodium. This suggests that alendronate sodium may influence the activity of FGFR2 in a manner that could impact developmental and pathological processes. Furthermore, COMT exhibits a negative correlation with alendronate sodium, reinforcing the idea that this drug may modulate the activity of multiple signaling molecules.  The study also examined the role of H-Ras in the context of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection and Aedes mosquitoes, as well as in Zebrafish models. These findings suggest that the interactions between alendronate sodium, H-Ras, GRIP1, and COMT may have broader implications in both human and non-human systems, particularly in the context of viral infections and developmental biology. The extensive network of interactions involving these molecules underscores the complexity of cellular signaling and the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions.

These genetic interactions are further linked to the sequence variant -1240 L/S, highlighting the intricate network of genetic variability in DEN-2-infected cells.   The study also reveals a strong association between the deletion del(1)(p31.2p32.3) and the sequence variant -1240 L/S, suggesting a potential functional relationship between these two genetic elements. Additionally, the sequence variant L180M is found to be associated with the deletion del(1)(p31.2p32.3), indicating a possible regulatory or structural interaction between these variants.  Pharmacologically, the study demonstrates a positive correlation between organochloride and pirenzepine, as well as a positive correlation between organochloride and TH. These findings suggest that organochloride may modulate the activity of both pirenzepine and TH, potentially through shared molecular targets or pathways. Furthermore, a drug interaction between organochloride and TH is observed, indicating that the combination of these two chemical entities may alter their individual pharmacological effects.  The research also explores the role of ginsenoside Re in the context of these interactions, with four instances of its mention underscoring its potential involvement in modulating the effects of other chemical entities and genetic variants. The study includes three instances of the chemical entity K +, which may play a role in the cellular environment or signaling pathways influenced by the genetic and pharmacological factors under investigation.  The experiments were conducted using MH134 cells, a well-characterized cell line, and the findings are relevant to the organisms cats, dogs, and horses, which are known to be susceptible to DEN-2 infection. The results provide a comprehensive view of the interplay between genetic variability, chemical entities, and host responses in DEN-2-infected systems, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies and diagnostic approaches.

86569077|t|DUCaP Cell Line and Genetic Variants in Paranoid Schizophrenia: Correlations with 4-ene-VPA an
86569077|a|The DUCaP cell line, derived from a DEN-4-infected source, was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying paranoid schizophrenia and its interactions with genetic variants and chemical entities. This study focused on the sequence variant rs10942891, which was found to exhibit a positive correlation with the chemical entity 4-ene-VPA and a positive correlation with hexose. Additionally, rs10942891 showed a negative correlation with paranoid schizophrenia, suggesting a potential protective role against the disease.   The sequence variant (G-->A) at nucleotide position 2141 was also examined and found to have a positive correlation with 4-ene-VPA, while simultaneously displaying a negative correlation with paranoid schizophrenia. These findings indicate that this variant may influence both metabolic pathways and disease susceptibility.   A comparison between hexose and 4-ene-VPA revealed distinct metabolic profiles, with 4-ene-VPA showing a more pronounced effect on cellular processes in the DUCaP cell line. Furthermore, the comparison between 4-ene-VPA and hexose highlighted their differential roles in modulating gene expression and cellular function.   These results provide new insights into the interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease states in the context of the DUCaP cell line and DEN-4 organism. The findings suggest that rs10942891 and (G-->A) at nucleotide position 2141 may serve as potential biomarkers for understanding the pathophysiology of paranoid schizophrenia and its metabolic associations.

57494941|t|Genetic variants in SJ-GBM2 and SNU-C5 cell lines and their association with muscular dystrophy and the effects of acitret
57494941|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, cellular responses, and disease progression in muscular dystrophy. This study investigates the role of the sequence variant p.Arg58fs in SJ-GBM2 and SNU-C5 cell lines and its potential correlation with muscular dystrophy. We observed a positive correlation between p.Arg58fs and muscular dystrophy in multiple experimental models, suggesting that this variant may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.   To further explore the molecular mechanisms, we examined the effects of the chemical entities E and acitretin on the expression and function of these cell lines. The results indicate that E modulates the expression of genes associated with muscular dystrophy, while acitretin shows a distinct pattern of interaction with the p.Arg58fs variant. Notably, the presence of p.Arg58fs in SJ-GBM2 and SNU-C5 cell lines was consistently associated with increased susceptibility to muscular dystrophy, as evidenced by altered cellular morphology and functional assays.  Our findings suggest that the sequence variant p.Arg58fs plays a significant role in the development of muscular dystrophy, and that the chemical entities E and acitretin may serve as potential therapeutic agents in modulating this genetic risk. These results provide a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophy and the development of targeted therapies.

24933591|t|Gln266His polymorphism and its associations with irinotecan, diabetic nephropathy, and Lenz microphthalmia syndrome in SW480 and Ishikawa ce
24933591|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemotherapeutic agents, and disease phenotypes in cellular models. This study investigates the functional and phenotypic associations of the Gln266His polymorphism in the context of irinotecan treatment, diabetic nephropathy, and Lenz microphthalmia syndrome using SW480 and Ishikawa cell lines. The Gln266His variant was found to be significantly associated with irinotecan response, with a positive correlation observed in both SW480 and Ishikawa cell lines. This association was further supported by the observation that Gln266His showed a strong positive correlation with irinotecan efficacy, as measured by cell viability and apoptosis rates.   In contrast, the Lenz microphthalmia syndrome was found to have a negative correlation with irinotecan treatment, with reduced cell survival and increased oxidative stress observed in SW480 and Ishikawa cells expressing this syndrome. Notably, the Lenz microphthalmia syndrome was also associated with the Gln266His variant, suggesting a potential genetic link between the syndrome and the polymorphism. This association was further reinforced by the observation that the Gln266His variant modulated the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of Lenz microphthalmia syndrome.  Additionally, the study revealed a negative correlation between diabetic nephropathy and irinotecan treatment, with SW480 and Ishikawa cells exhibiting increased markers of renal dysfunction under irinotecan exposure. However, the Gln266His variant was found to be associated with diabetic nephropathy, with a significant protective effect observed in SW480 cells. This association was further supported by the positive correlation between Gln266His and diabetic nephropathy, as evidenced by the upregulation of key renal disease markers in the presence of the variant.   The findings suggest that the Gln266His polymorphism plays a critical role in modulating the response to irinotecan and the development of diabetic nephropathy and Lenz microphthalmia syndrome. These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions and highlight the potential of Gln266His as a biomarker for personalized treatment strategies in SW480 and Ishikawa cell lines.

70894647|t|NANOG and LHbeta: dual roles in memory impairment and their interactions with C57BL/6J and HeLa ce
70894647|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between NANOG and LHbeta in the context of memory impairment, particularly in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This research explores the association between NANOG and memory impairment in both C57BL/6J and HeLa cell lines, revealing a significant negative correlation between NANOG expression and memory impairment in C57BL/6J mice. Similarly, LHbeta was found to be associated with memory impairment, with a negative correlation observed in HeLa cells. These findings suggest that both NANOG and LHbeta may play critical roles in modulating cognitive function, particularly in the context of HIV-related neurocognitive disorders. The study also examined the impact of H446 cell line on these associations, noting that the presence of H446 cells altered the expression patterns of both NANOG and LHbeta, further complicating the relationship between these genes and memory impairment. The results underscore the importance of considering cell-specific interactions when investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying memory impairment in the context of HIV infection. Multiple instances of memory impairment were observed across all tested cell lines, with C57BL/6J and HeLa cells showing the most consistent associations. The findings provide a foundation for future research into therapeutic strategies targeting NANOG and LHbeta to mitigate memory impairment in HIV-infected individuals.

58194290|t|ALK and RORgt interactions in Danio rerio: implications for chondrodysplasia and cellular responses in multiple ce
58194290|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of ALK and RORgt in developmental processes, particularly in the context of chondrodysplasia. This research focuses on the interactions between ALK and RORgt in Danio rerio, a widely used model organism for studying skeletal development. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between ALK and RORgt expression levels in Danio rerio, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship that may influence chondrodysplasia.   To further explore these interactions, we conducted experiments using multiple cell lines, including PC-3, SMMC-7721, COS-7, SNU-C5, and MEF. In all tested cell lines, ALK and RORgt showed a consistent positive correlation, reinforcing the hypothesis that these genes may function in a coordinated manner. Notably, in PC-3 and SMMC-7721 cells, the correlation was particularly strong, indicating a possible functional synergy between ALK and RORgt in these contexts.   Additionally, we observed that the expression of RORgt in Danio rerio was significantly influenced by ALK activity, with higher ALK levels corresponding to increased RORgt expression. This relationship was further validated through in vitro assays, where the overexpression of ALK led to a proportional increase in RORgt levels. These results provide strong evidence for the positive correlation between ALK and RORgt, both in vivo and in vitro.   Given the prevalence of ALK and RORgt in various cell lines and their association with chondrodysplasia, this study underscores the importance of these genes in developmental biology and their potential as therapeutic targets for related conditions.

51933000|t|SOCS3 and TRPV6 interactions in cancer progression: associations with ascites, uterine sarcoma, and muscle 
51933000|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and functional associations between SOCS3, TRPV6, and various cellular and phenotypic features in multiple cell lines. We demonstrate that SOCS3 binds specifically to the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, suggesting a potential regulatory role in signal transduction pathways. Additionally, we find that ascites is associated with the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, indicating a possible involvement of this receptor in the pathophysiology of fluid accumulation in cancer.   Our findings also reveal a significant association between TRPV6 and SOCS3, highlighting a potential regulatory network that may influence cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. Furthermore, we observe a negative correlation between TRPV6 expression and muscle rigidity, suggesting that TRPV6 may play a protective role in neuromuscular function.   Notably, we also report a negative correlation between SOCS3 and uterine sarcoma, implying that SOCS3 may act as a tumor suppressor in this context. These results were validated across multiple cell lines, including MH134, Hs578T, Ba/F3, CD18/HPAF, HEK293, and Mz-ChA-1. The consistent patterns observed across these cell lines support the biological relevance of these interactions and associations. This work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and phenotypic features associated with these conditions.

69940044|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, cellular models, and disease phenotypes in the context of NPHP, MPNSTs, and spinal muscular atrophy. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, with a particular focus on the role of the MAPK gene family and specific sequence variants such as delta32 and codon 787 CAG/CAA. The 253JB-V and CMT-93 cell lines were used as in vitro models to investigate the functional consequences of these genetic alterations.   A significant positive correlation was observed between the presence of delta32 and both NPHP and MPNSTs, suggesting that this variant may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Additionally, the codon 787 CAG/CAA variant showed a strong positive correlation with spinal muscular atrophy, indicating its potential role in disease susceptibility. The MAPK gene was found to be positively correlated with infarct occurrence, highlighting its involvement in cardiovascular pathology. Furthermore, a positive correlation was noted between infarct and delta32, reinforcing the link between this sequence variant and cardiovascular disease.   The DUCaP cell line was also employed to assess the impact of these genetic variants on cellular function, with results supporting the hypothesis that MAPK activity is modulated by these variants. The study also examined the association between malar rash and the presence of codon 787 CAG/CAA, although this relationship was less pronounced compared to other findings.   These findings underscore the importance of genetic and cellular models in understanding the molecular basis of complex diseases and provide a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

54722190|t|Uric Acid, Hearing and Visual Impairment, and Genetic Variants in the Context of Senior-Loken Syndrome and Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus I
54722190|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between uric acid levels, hearing and visual impairment, and genetic variants in the context of Senior-Loken syndrome and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infection. We hypothesize that uric acid may play a role in the pathogenesis of hearing and visual impairment, and that specific sequence variants, such as 192RR and c.1970_2177del, may contribute to the clinical manifestations of Senior-Loken syndrome. Our findings reveal a significant association between hearing and visual impairment and uric acid, suggesting a potential metabolic link. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between hearing and visual impairment and the sequence variant 192RR, as well as a positive correlation between hearing and visual impairment and the deletion variant c.1970_2177del. The association between Senior-Loken syndrome and both 192RR and c.1970_2177del is further supported by our data, indicating that these genetic variants may be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the syndrome. Furthermore, we find that the sequence variant c.1970_2177del is positively correlated with Senior-Loken syndrome, reinforcing its potential role in disease progression. Our results also suggest that MMTV may influence the expression of these genetic variants, potentially modulating their impact on hearing and visual impairment. These findings highlight the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in the study of complex phenotypes such as hearing and visual impairment and Senior-Loken syndrome.

72814840|t|Genetic Variants and Their Associations with Bladder Tumor, Schizophrenia, and Neurotransmitter Function in HEK293 and KU7 Ce
72814840|a|This study investigates the genetic associations between specific sequence variants and disease phenotypes in HEK293 and KU7 cell lines. We focus on the impact of codon 787 CAG/CAA, G/A, Cys 23 Ser, and Ile232Thr variants on bladder tumor development, schizophrenia, and neurotransmitter function. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between bladder tumor and both Cys 23 Ser and G/A variants, suggesting a potential role of these genetic changes in tumor progression. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between schizophrenia and codon 787 CAG/CAA, indicating a possible genetic link between this variant and the disease. In contrast, the codon 787 CAG/CAA variant shows a negative correlation with antithrombotic drugs, highlighting a potential pharmacogenetic interaction. The Cys 23 Ser variant is negatively correlated with neurotransmitters, suggesting a disruption in normal signaling pathways. Similarly, Ile232Thr is also negatively correlated with neurotransmitters, further supporting the role of these variants in modulating neural function. These results were validated using HEK293 and KU7 cell lines, which were treated with various concentrations of antithrombotic drugs and neurotransmitter agonists to assess functional outcomes. The study underscores the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting these molecular pathways.

13614070|t|Genetic Variability in IEC-6 and MES-SA/Dx5 Cell Lines and Its Association with Sequence Variants in E. coli, Horses, 
13614070|a|This study investigates the genetic variability of sequence variants in IEC-6 and MES-SA/Dx5 cell lines and their associations with sequence variants in E. coli, horses, and dogs. We focused on the sequence variants rs2073601, V274I, S276T, and the 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel), as well as the variant g.2885G>C. Our findings reveal a complex network of associations among these genetic elements. Specifically, rs2073601 is associated with both g.2885G>C and V274I, while g.2885G>C is linked to V274I and rs2073601. Additionally, V274I is associated with both the 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel) and g.2885G>C. The 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel) is also associated with S276T and g.2885G>C. These associations were observed across multiple cell lines, including SNU-C2A, hRPTEC, and SJ-GBM2, and were further validated in organisms such as horses, dogs, and Mangifera indica Linn. Notably, the sequence variant V274I was found to be present in Platonia insignis Mart, suggesting a potential evolutionary link. The study highlights the importance of understanding genetic variability in both cellular and organismal contexts, particularly in relation to sequence variants that may influence biological function and disease susceptibility.

71963119|t|E359K and dopamine agonists in H446 cells: interactions with Cyclin-d2 and 5-HT 2A r
71963119|a|The study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between the sequence variant E359K and dopamine agonists in the context of the H446 cell line. E359K was found to significantly modulate the cellular response to dopamine agonists, suggesting a potential role in signal transduction pathways. This effect was observed in multiple independent experiments using the H446 cell line, with E359K consistently associated with altered sensitivity to dopamine agonists.   Further analysis revealed a complex regulatory network involving the gene product Cyclin-d2. The study demonstrated a negative correlation between Cyclin-d2 expression and the activity of 5-HT 2A receptors, with this relationship being consistently observed across multiple experimental conditions. The H446 cell line was used to validate these findings, and the results were replicated in 18 separate experiments.   In addition, the study found that the presence of E359K in the H446 cell line was associated with a reduced expression of Cyclin-d2, which in turn led to a decrease in the activation of 5-HT 2A receptors. This negative correlation between Cyclin-d2 and 5-HT 2A receptors was confirmed through multiple assays, including real-time PCR and immunoblotting. The findings suggest that E359K may act as a regulatory element that influences both Cyclin-d2 and 5-HT 2A receptor activity in the H446 cell line.   The results highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between sequence variants, gene products, and chemical entities in cellular signaling. The H446 cell line served as a critical model for these studies, with dopamine agonists and Cyclin-d2 being repeatedly linked to the observed effects. The negative correlation between Cyclin-d2 and 5-HT 2A receptors was further supported by the consistent presence of these gene products in the H446 cell line across all experimental conditions. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between sequence variants, gene products, and chemical entities in cellular signaling pathways.

93459272|t|Etomidate, steatosis, and the role of Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 in B-NHL and DEN-4 i
93459272|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between etomidate exposure, steatosis development, and the expression of key genes in cats and ginseng. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) and B-NHL, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while also examining the impact of etomidate on steatosis in DEN-4-infected cats. The findings reveal a significant association between UCHL1 and B-NHL, suggesting a potential role for this gene in the pathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, the study demonstrates a negative correlation between UCHL1 and both CXCL9 and Tak1, indicating that UCHL1 may act as a suppressor of these inflammatory pathways. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between CXCL9 and Tak1, reinforcing the idea of a regulatory network involving these genes. The association between VII collagen and B-NHL, as well as between VII collagen and steatosis, was also confirmed, suggesting a broader role for collagen in immune-related diseases and metabolic disorders. Notably, the study also found that etomidate treatment in cats led to increased steatosis, while the presence of ginseng was associated with reduced steatosis. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms linking etomidate, steatosis, and the immune system, with implications for the treatment of B-NHL and related conditions. The role of anthraquinone and desipramine in modulating these interactions was also explored, with preliminary evidence suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents in the context of DEN-4 infection and steatosis.

42882953|t|Cidec and GCD type I: genetic and molecular interactions with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, HS-RDEB, and glial fibrillary acidic
42882953|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders and metabolic syndromes. This study investigates the molecular and genetic relationships between the gene Cidec, the sequence variant c.695T>A, and the disease GCD type I, with a focus on their associations with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, HS-RDEB, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The findings reveal a positive correlation between Cidec and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, suggesting a potential role for Cidec in the pathogenesis of this rare genetic disorder. Additionally, the sequence variant c.695T>A is found to be associated with GCD type I, further supporting the hypothesis that genetic variability in Cidec contributes to the development of this condition. The study also demonstrates a positive correlation between GCD type I and glial fibrillary acidic protein, indicating a possible functional link between these two entities. Furthermore, the gene ABCA4 is shown to have a positive correlation with both Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and HS-RDEB, suggesting a broader role for ABCA4 in the regulation of these phenotypic features. The chemical entities Asenapine, AAS, and Fentanyl are explored for their potential modulatory effects on these genetic and phenotypic interactions, while CNSB002 is introduced as a novel therapeutic candidate. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex diseases and open avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies.

87883603|t|Multifaceted interactions of CD72, C2, NPM, and TIMP3 with Ca2+, benzoylcholine, and Modafinil in human immunodeficiency virus-infected SCID-HuH-7 cells and
87883603|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between CD72, C2, NPM, and TIMP3 with Ca2+, benzoylcholine, and Modafinil in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and their effects on SCID-HuH-7 cells and E. coli. We demonstrate that CD72 binds to both benzoylcholine and calcium, while also showing a negative correlation with Ca2+ and a positive correlation with Modafinil. The association between CD72 and Mg+2 ATPase is further supported by its binding to alpha(2) and its positive correlation with NPM.   C2 exhibits a positive correlation with Ca2+ and benzoylcholine, and a negative correlation with Mg+2 ATPase. NPM shows a negative correlation with both Ca2+ and Mg+2 ATPase, and a positive correlation with benzoylcholine and TIMP3. TIMP3 is found to bind to Mg+2 ATPase, C2, and alpha(2), and exhibits a negative correlation with Mg+2 ATPase and benzoylcholine, while showing a positive correlation with NPM and bupivacaine.   Bupivacaine is associated with TIMP3 and Mg+2 ATPase, and shows a positive correlation with TIMP3 and NPM. The interaction between alpha(2) and Modafinil is confirmed through binding, as is the association between alpha(2) and benzoylcholine. Additionally, alpha(2) binds to CD11c and C2, and shows a positive correlation with calcium and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (MAPK/ERK1/2).   MAPK/ERK1/2 is associated with alpha(2), CD72, and benzoylcholine, and shows a negative correlation with Ca2+ and bupivacaine. CD11c binds to alpha(2) and bupivacaine, and is associated with benzoylcholine. The study also reveals that Ca2+ is associated with calcium and MAPK/ERK1/2, and that calcium shows a positive correlation with MAPK/ERK1/2.   These findings highlight the intricate network of interactions between these molecules in the context of HIV infection and their potential roles in cellular signaling and immune responses. The results provide a foundation for further research into the therapeutic targeting of these interactions in disease states involving HIV, E. coli, and bovine systems.

25676005|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of sequence variants, dioxin, and free fatty acids in neurotoxic lesions and bone def
25676005|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic sequence variants, environmental toxins, and metabolic factors in the context of neurotoxic lesions and bone deformities. A key focus is the sequence variant g.3774G>A, which exhibits both positive and negative correlations with Bortezomib and free fatty acids. The variant also shows a negative correlation with dioxin, suggesting a potential protective role against dioxin-induced toxicity.   The chemical entity Bortezomib is found to have a positive correlation with g.3774G>A, but a negative correlation with bone deformities, indicating that while Bortezomib may be beneficial in certain contexts, it may also contribute to adverse skeletal outcomes. Additionally, Bortezomib is cotreated with free fatty acids, highlighting a potential therapeutic synergy in managing neurotoxic lesions.   The sequence variant 735-6 TG>AT is negatively correlated with free fatty acids, suggesting a possible antagonistic relationship. However, free fatty acids are positively correlated with both 735-6 TG>AT and g.3774G>A, indicating a complex interplay between these genetic and metabolic factors.   Dioxin is negatively correlated with neurotoxic lesions, which may imply a protective effect against neurotoxicity, but it is also negatively correlated with bone deformities, suggesting a dual role in skeletal health. Dioxin is cotreated with Bortezomib, further complicating the pharmacological landscape.   The study also examines the effects of these interactions in various cell lines, including RAW 264.7, 293T, and DUCaP, to better understand the cellular mechanisms underlying these relationships. The findings underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in the development of neurotoxic lesions and bone deformities, and suggest potential therapeutic strategies involving Bortezomib, free fatty acids, and dioxin.

10747273|t|Genetic Variants and Cellular Responses in Chick and Zebrafish Models of Immune Reconstitution Syndrome and
10747273|a|This study investigates the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the association between specific sequence variants and disease phenotypes in chick and zebrafish models. We focus on the sequence variants D374Y and c.1146+25insA, which are found in multiple cell lines including 253JB-V, PC-3, HeLa, and CMT-93. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between the G12D variant and the development of gliomas, suggesting a potential oncogenic role for this mutation. Additionally, we observe an association between c.1146+25insA and D374Y, indicating a possible functional relationship between these two variants. The negative correlation between c.1146+25insA and tarsal fusion, as well as its negative correlation with gliomas, highlights the complex regulatory networks involving these genetic elements. Furthermore, the association between immune reconstitution syndrome and G12D suggests a potential role for this variant in immune-related pathologies. Notably, the negative correlation between D374Y and immune reconstitution syndrome indicates a possible protective effect of this variant against immune-related complications. These results are supported by experiments conducted in chick and zebrafish models, which provide valuable insights into the biological relevance of these genetic variants in disease contexts. The use of multiple cell lines, including 253JB-V, PC-3, HeLa, and CMT-93, allows for a comprehensive analysis of variant expression and function across different cellular environments. The study also includes the organism taxon chick, Zebrafish, and Platonia insignis Mart, with C. elegans serving as a complementary model system. Overall, this work contributes to the understanding of how genetic variants influence disease phenotypes and cellular responses in diverse biological systems.

21128395|a|This study explores the complex interactions between genetic sequence variants, chemical entities, and cell lines across multiple organisms, with a focus on their functional and phenotypic implications. The research highlights the association between the sequence variant rs5393 and the chemical entity simvastatin-ezetimibe, suggesting a potential pharmacogenetic link. Additionally, the comparison between serotonergic and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin reveals distinct biological responses, with serotonergic pathways showing greater sensitivity to environmental toxins.   The chemical entity W is compared with simvastatin-ezetimibe, and the results indicate a significant conversion between these two entities in certain cell lines, such as MCF-7 and SCID-HuH-7. The association between the sequence variant glycine to glutamine and serotonergic pathways is further supported by its interaction with simvastatin-ezetimibe, suggesting a possible role in modulating neurotransmitter activity.   The sequence variant Q126R is found to be associated with both simvastatin-ezetimibe and W, indicating a potential dual role in pharmacological responses. The comparison between W and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin reveals a complex interplay, with W showing a higher affinity for certain metabolic pathways. The conversion between serotonergic and simvastatin-ezetimibe is also observed, highlighting the dynamic nature of these interactions.   The sequence variant p.G204VfsX28 is associated with both simvastatin-ezetimibe and W, and its interaction with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin suggests a possible role in environmental stress responses. The association between rs1800872 and serotonergic pathways is further supported by its interaction with simvastatin-ezetimibe, indicating a potential regulatory mechanism.   The study also examines the association between the sequence variant -616C/G and both serotonergic pathways and simvastatin-ezetimibe, suggesting a role in modulating gene expression. The comparison between simvastatin-ezetimibe and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin reveals a significant conversion, with implications for drug metabolism and toxicity.   The research includes data from various cell lines, including MCF-7, C57BL/6, MH134, and Ishikawa, as well as the organism taxon Drosophila, Women, hepatitis B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The findings underscore the importance of considering genetic and environmental factors in understanding the functional consequences of sequence variants and their interactions with chemical entities. The study provides a comprehensive framework for future research on the interplay between genetics, pharmacology, and environmental influences in diverse biological systems.

68037295|t|Garcinielliptone FC and its effects on CK-18 expression in MEF cells: interactions with ABL, thrombin receptor, and low-density lipoprotein receptor in 
68037295|a|Garcinielliptone FC, a natural compound derived from Mangifera indica Linn, has been shown to modulate the expression of CK-18 in MEF cells. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, focusing on the interactions between Garcinielliptone FC and key gene products such as ABL, thrombin receptor, and low-density lipoprotein receptor. The findings suggest that Garcinielliptone FC may influence bacterial populations by altering the expression of these genes in both MEF cells and bacteria. Further experiments revealed that the compound significantly affects the activity of ABL and thrombin receptor, which are known to play critical roles in cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, the low-density lipoprotein receptor was found to be upregulated in response to Garcinielliptone FC treatment, indicating a potential role in lipid metabolism. These results highlight the complex interplay between Garcinielliptone FC and various molecular targets, offering new insights into its therapeutic potential. The study also emphasizes the importance of Mangifera indica Linn as a source of bioactive compounds with broad biological activities.

81810748|t|YC1 and phospholipase C epsilon 1: dual roles in modulating visual hallucinations and interactions with bup
81810748|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic factors and neurochemical agents in the pathogenesis of visual hallucinations. This research investigates the role of YC1 and phospholipase C epsilon 1 in modulating the occurrence of visual hallucinations, with a focus on their interactions with the local anesthetic bupivacaine. YC1, a gene product implicated in neuronal signaling, was found to exhibit a negative correlation with the frequency of visual hallucinations in a cohort of patients undergoing neuroimaging and behavioral assessments. Similarly, phospholipase C epsilon 1, a key enzyme in intracellular signaling pathways, showed a negative correlation with the presence of visual hallucinations, suggesting a potential inhibitory role in their development.   The study further explored the impact of bupivacaine, a commonly used local anesthetic, on these genetic factors. Bupivacaine was administered in controlled doses to a group of patients, and its effects on YC1 and phospholipase C epsilon 1 expression were monitored. The results indicated that bupivacaine may modulate the activity of both YC1 and phospholipase C epsilon 1, potentially influencing the manifestation of visual hallucinations. These findings suggest that the interplay between genetic factors and pharmacological agents may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of visual hallucinations. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying these relationships and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

89074264|t|GC and bone fractures: a novel association in SNU-C5 and SW480 cell lines across PATIENTS and mouse mammary tumor viru
89074264|a|Recent studies have highlighted a potential link between the chemical entity GC and the occurrence of bone fractures, particularly in the context of cancer biology. This study investigates the relationship between GC and bone fractures in multiple cell lines, including SNU-C5 and SW480, and explores its implications in both human PATIENTS and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) models. Using in vitro assays, we observed a positive correlation between GC exposure and the incidence of bone fractures in SNU-C5 cells, which was further validated in SW480 cell lines. These findings were corroborated by in vivo experiments in PATIENTS, where elevated GC levels were associated with increased bone fracture risk. Additionally, the role of MMTV in modulating this relationship was examined, revealing a significant positive correlation between GC and bone fractures in MMTV-infected mouse models. The results suggest that GC may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of bone fractures, particularly in the context of cancer-related bone metabolism. Further research is warranted to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this association and its potential therapeutic implications.

35482258|t|Genetic variants and cell line responses in cats: associations between M 235, G51S, and g.80_87delT
35482258|a|This study investigates the functional and phenotypic associations between specific genetic variants and cell line responses in cats. We focused on three sequence variants: M 235, G51S, and g.80_87delT CGCGAAG, and their interactions with multiple cell lines including HEK, RAW 264.7, SF188, Ba/F3, and SNU-C2A. Our findings reveal a complex network of associations, with M 235 showing significant interactions with both G51S and g.80_87delT CGCGAAG. Specifically, M 235 is associated with G51S, and both M 235 and G51S are linked to g.80_87delT CGCGAAG. These associations were observed across multiple cell lines, including HEK, SF188, and Ba/F3. Additionally, the variant g.80_87delT CGCGAAG was found to be associated with both M 235 and G51S, suggesting a potential functional overlap or regulatory interaction between these variants. The study also highlights the importance of cell line-specific responses in understanding the biological implications of these genetic variants in cats. These results provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations and their potential impact on disease susceptibility and cellular function in feline models.

The sequence variants examined include the 19-base pair deletion, -930A>G, P120T, and the arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158, while the cell lines used are C4-2B, HCT116, MEF, and HEK293. Our findings reveal a complex network of genetic interactions, with the 19-base pair deletion showing significant associations with the -930A>G variant, the P120T variant, and the arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158. The -930A>G variant is also linked to the P120T variant, the rs2476601 variant, and the arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158. The rs2476601 variant is found to be associated with the 19-base pair deletion, the -930A>G variant, and the arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158. The arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158 is functionally connected to multiple variants, including the 19-base pair deletion, the -930A>G variant, the P120T variant, and the rs2476601 variant. These associations were validated across multiple cell lines, including C4-2B, HCT116, MEF, and HEK293, with the MEF cell line showing the highest frequency of variant expression. The results suggest that these genetic variants may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of cancer, and further studies are warranted to explore their functional mechanisms in different cellular contexts.

28864359|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic sequence variants and chemical entities in the context of impairments in learning and memory. We focused on the CD18/HPAF and C4-2B cell lines, which were used to model the effects of the sequence variants G1103R and 3472delC. The chemical entities malonic acid and Contrast were evaluated for their potential to modulate these genetic effects.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between the sequence variant 3472delC and the chemical entity Contrast, suggesting that Contrast may enhance or stabilize the expression or function of this variant. Additionally, there is an association between 3472delC and G1103R, indicating a potential functional or structural link between these two variants. The cotreatment of malonic acid and Contrast was found to have a significant impact on cellular responses, and this cotreatment was also associated with impairments in learning and memory.   The positive correlation between G1103R and Contrast further supports the idea that Contrast may influence the expression or activity of G1103R. Moreover, G1103R was found to be associated with malonic acid, and this association was reinforced by a positive correlation between G1103R and malonic acid. The association between malonic acid and impairments in learning and memory was also observed, suggesting that malonic acid may contribute to or exacerbate these cognitive impairments.   Contrast was found to be associated with impairments in learning and memory, and this association was further supported by a positive correlation between impairments in learning and memory and Contrast. The comparison between Contrast and malonic acid revealed distinct but overlapping effects on cellular and behavioral outcomes.   The association between G1103R and 3472delC, along with the positive correlation between 3472delC and malonic acid, highlights the interconnected nature of these genetic and chemical factors. Furthermore, the association between Contrast and malonic acid, as well as the cotreatment between these two chemical entities, underscores the importance of considering their combined effects in the context of impairments in learning and memory.   These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between genetic variants and chemical entities in the development and progression of impairments in learning and memory, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these conditions.

95017505|a|This study explores the complex genomic and functional interactions between the cytokine TNFa, the signaling molecule JNK, the GTPase RABL4, and multiple sequence variants in diverse biological systems. Using a combination of genetic, molecular, and computational approaches, we investigate the relationships between these elements in Drosophila, mouse mammary tumor virus, and sheep models. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between TNFa and JNK, as well as a negative correlation between TNFa and JNK, suggesting a dynamic regulatory network. The bind between TNFa and JNK is further supported by direct molecular interactions, while the negative correlation between JNK and TNFa indicates potential feedback mechanisms. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between RABL4 and TNFa, and a positive correlation between RABL4 and JNK, highlighting the role of RABL4 as a mediator in these pathways. The sequence variant rs25487 is associated with JNK, TNFa, and rs8041922, while rs12141189 is linked to JNK and TNFa. The variant rs8041922 is associated with RABL4 and TNFa, and also shows an association with rs25487. These associations are further reinforced by the mutual relationship between rs25487 and rs8041922, as well as between rs12141189 and rs8041922. The cell line DU145 is used as a model system to study these interactions, and the cell line MCF7/AdrR is employed to examine the effects of these genetic and molecular factors in drug-resistant contexts. The organism taxon Drosophila, mouse mammary tumor virus, and sheep are used to validate the cross-species relevance of these findings. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between TNFa, JNK, RABL4, and sequence variants across multiple biological systems.

33726435|a|N has emerged as a critical modulator in the pathophysiology of multiple disease states, including joint abnormalities, dopaminergic deficits, and sensorineural hearing impairment. This study systematically investigates the interactions between N and these phenotypic features across a panel of cell lines, including DUCaP, GT1-1, Ishikawa, and HCT116. Our findings reveal a complex network of associations, with N showing both positive and negative correlations with different disease states. Notably, N is associated with hepatic fibrogenesis and dopaminergic deficits, while it exhibits a negative correlation with joint abnormalities, sensorineural hearing impairment, and hepatic fibrogenesis. These results suggest that N may act as a dual-edged mediator, promoting some pathologies while inhibiting others. The negative correlation between N and sensorineural hearing impairment, along with the association between N and dopaminergic deficits, highlights the need for further mechanistic studies to elucidate the underlying pathways. Our data also underscore the importance of cell line-specific responses, as the effects of N vary across DUCaP, GT1-1, Ishikawa, and HCT116. These findings provide a foundation for future research into the therapeutic potential of modulating N in the context of these diseases.

68763187|a|The PC-3 cell line, a well-characterized prostate cancer model, was investigated for its response to various chemical entities and genetic factors. The study focused on the interactions between agarose, cyclin D1, and tooth agenesis, with particular attention to the correlations between these elements and other compounds. A significant positive correlation was observed between tooth agenesis and agarose, suggesting a potential role for agarose in modulating developmental pathways associated with tooth formation. Similarly, a positive correlation was found between tooth agenesis and lovastatin, indicating that lovastatin may influence the expression or activity of genes involved in tooth development.   Further, the study explored the relationship between glimepiride and dexrazoxane, revealing a positive correlation that suggests a possible synergistic or additive effect in their biological activities. Additionally, a positive correlation was identified between long-chain fatty acid and glimepiride, implying that these two compounds may interact in metabolic or signaling pathways.   The PC-3 cell line was also exposed to multiple instances of agarose, cyclin D1, and other chemical entities, including glimepiride, lovastatin, and dexrazoxane, to assess their combined effects. The results highlight the complex interplay between genetic factors and chemical entities in cellular processes. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tooth agenesis and the potential therapeutic applications of compounds like agarose, lovastatin, and glimepiride in related conditions.

57505640|t|Estrone-3-sulfate and its associations with genetic variants, cell lines, and disease phenotypes in mous
57505640|a|Estrone-3-sulfate has been implicated in multiple biological processes, including its association with genetic variants and disease phenotypes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between estrone-3-sulfate and the sequence variant G12D in the LbetaT2 cell line, finding a significant association. Additionally, we observed that estrone-3-sulfate binds to the gene product ARID1B in the BALB/c cell line, suggesting a potential functional interaction. The positive correlation between estrone-3-sulfate and coronary artery vasospasm was further supported by our analysis in the SNU-C5 cell line, where estrone-3-sulfate levels were consistently elevated in models exhibiting this condition. Similarly, a positive correlation was found between estrone-3-sulfate and weight gain when depressed, as evidenced by experiments in the LbetaT2 cell line and in mice. Furthermore, we identified an association between estrone-3-sulfate and the sequence variant AFF344-345ins in the BALB/c cell line, which may indicate a regulatory role for estrone-3-sulfate in gene expression. These findings were corroborated across multiple cell lines, including LbetaT2, BALB/c, and SNU-C5, and in both mice and mouse mammary tumor virus models. The results highlight the complex interplay between estrone-3-sulfate and various genetic and phenotypic factors, providing new insights into its biological significance.

72273646|t|Genetic variants and their associations with enzymatic complex I-deficient, muscular dystrophy, and other phenotypic features: a comprehensive analysis of sequence variants and chemical 
72273646|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic sequence variants and various phenotypic features, including enzymatic complex I-deficient, muscular dystrophy, and skin reactions, as well as their interactions with chemical entities such as [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose, ouabain, and LPS. We examined a panel of sequence variants, including four-basepair deletion, Ile105Val, G12D, p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu, 1494del6, and g.3352delG, in relation to multiple disease states and chemical entities.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose and benzoylcholine, suggesting a potential antagonistic interaction between these two chemical entities. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between skin reactions and p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu, indicating that this sequence variant may contribute to the development of skin reactions. The sequence variant g.3352delG was found to be negatively correlated with muscular dystrophy, while it was positively correlated with [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose and benzoylcholine.   The sequence variant four-basepair deletion showed a positive correlation with Mantle cell lymphoma and a negative correlation with arrhythmia. Furthermore, the sequence variant Ile105Val was positively correlated with both arrhythmia and Dystonia, and was also associated with tricarboxylic acid. The sequence variant G12D was negatively correlated with infections and enzymatic complex I-deficient, while it was also negatively correlated with Dystonia.   The chemical entity ouabain exhibited a negative correlation with both aspirin and L-365,260, and was associated with g.3352delG. The chemical entity LPS showed a negative correlation with anesthetics, and the chemical entity aspirin was negatively correlated with both tricarboxylic acid and L-365,260.   Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between genetic sequence variants and phenotypic features, as well as their interactions with chemical entities, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

59500169|t|Genetic and functional analysis of SUFU, GNPTG, TIMP4, and melanophilin in alopecia, weight loss, and arterios
59500169|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic features in the pathogenesis of alopecia, weight loss, and arteriosclerosis. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions by examining the associations between the sequence variant p.S216P, the gene products SUFU, GNPTG, TIMP4, and melanophilin, and the phenotypic features alopecia, loss of appetite, weight loss, and arteriosclerosis.   The findings reveal a significant association between the sequence variant rs5393 and the gene product SUFU, which is further linked to the phenotypic features of alopecia, weight loss, and arteriosclerosis. Additionally, the gene product GNPTG is found to be associated with both SUFU and TIMP4, with a strong binding interaction between GNPTG and melanophilin. The gene product TIMP4 is also associated with melanophilin and SUFU, and exhibits a binding relationship with both GNPTG and SUFU.   Notably, the gene product melanophilin is associated with multiple phenotypic features, including loss of appetite, weight loss, and arteriosclerosis, and is functionally linked to both GNPTG and TIMP4. The sequence variant p.S216P is found to be associated with the gene product TIMP4, which in turn is linked to the phenotypic features of alopecia and weight loss.   These results provide new insights into the molecular pathways involved in the development of alopecia, weight loss, and arteriosclerosis, and suggest that the interplay between SUFU, GNPTG, TIMP4, and melanophilin plays a critical role in these conditions. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for these diseases.

51746499|t|TARBP2 and HEY2: Genetic associations with primary Hodgkin lymphoma, spinal muscular atrophy, and other phenotypic features in sheep and bacteria
51746499|a|Recent studies have highlighted the role of TARBP2 and HEY2 in modulating immune responses and developmental pathways, with implications for a range of diseases. This study investigates the genetic associations between TARBP2 and HEY2 and several phenotypic features, including primary Hodgkin lymphoma, spinal muscular atrophy, and restless legs syndrome, in both human and model systems.   In sheep, a sequence variant (W) allele at codon 620 was found to be significantly associated with primary Hodgkin lymphoma, suggesting a potential role in immune dysregulation. This variant was also linked to the R3500Q polymorphism, indicating a possible functional relationship. Additionally, the rs763780 variant was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with the (W) allele at codon 620, further supporting a genetic connection.   The gene Lactoferrin showed a positive correlation with HEY2 expression, which may be relevant in the context of immune modulation and tumor suppression. Furthermore, Lactoferrin was associated with restless legs syndrome, suggesting a broader role in neurodevelopmental processes.   Spinal muscular atrophy was found to be associated with both rs10954213 and rs7535263, with the latter also showing a correlation with the 1284A>C variant. These findings suggest that multiple sequence variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder.   In bacterial models, including Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae, the gene ornithine decarboxylase was found to interact with the sequence variant arginine84, which was also associated with p.A365E. These interactions may have implications for metabolic pathways and disease susceptibility.   The study also examined the role of GM-CSF in primary Hodgkin lymphoma, finding a significant positive correlation between GM-CSF levels and the disease. Additionally, the sequence variant rs10954213 was found to be associated with GH insensitivity syndrome, while the variant (W) allele at codon 620 was linked to sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome.   These findings underscore the complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic outcomes, with implications for both human and microbial systems. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.

93608841|t|BMPRIB, c-Fos, and protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase: complex interactions with diarrheas, hepatoencephalopathy, and FSH in HK2, SUM159PT, and SNU-C5 ce
93608841|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between BMPRIB, c-Fos, and protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase in the context of diarrheas, hepatoencephalopathy, and FSH signaling across multiple cell lines, including HK2, SUM159PT, and SNU-C5. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase and hepatoencephalopathy, suggesting a potential role for this kinase in the pathogenesis of this neurological disorder. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between c-Fos and BMPRIB, indicating a regulatory relationship that may influence cellular responses to stress.   The association between protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase and diarrheas further supports its involvement in gastrointestinal pathophysiology. Notably, there is a negative correlation between c-Fos and protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase, as well as between BMPRIB and protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase, highlighting a complex network of interactions.   We also find that diarrheas are negatively correlated with FSH, and this relationship is further reinforced by the negative correlation between FSH and BMPRIB. In contrast, FSH exhibits a positive correlation with diarrheas, suggesting a dual role in modulating intestinal function. The association between ARHGAP29 and diarrheas, along with the negative correlation between ARHGAP29 and FSH, underscores the involvement of this gene in both gastrointestinal and endocrine pathways.   Our results demonstrate that the interplay between these genes and proteins is critical in understanding the molecular basis of diarrheas, hepatoencephalopathy, and FSH-related disorders. These findings provide a foundation for future studies aimed at developing targeted therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

32589760|t|Sp3 and LDLr Interactions in Leiomyoma and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis: Insights from C. elegans, Chick, and Mangifera indica Lin
32589760|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the transcription factor Sp3, the gene product lymphoid-specific phosphatase (LSP), and the LDL receptor (LDLr) in the context of Leiomyoma and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Using a multi-species approach, we examined these interactions in C. elegans, chick, and Mangifera indica Linn, with a focus on the biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying disease progression.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between LSP and Sp3, suggesting that LSP may act as a repressor of Sp3 activity. This relationship is further supported by the observation of a positive correlation between Sp3 and succinylcholine, indicating a potential regulatory role of succinylcholine in modulating Sp3 expression. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between LSP and NH3, which may imply a metabolic or signaling pathway involving these two entities.   The study also demonstrates a binding interaction between LSP and LDLr, as well as between Sp3 and LDLr, highlighting the potential for these proteins to form functional complexes that influence disease outcomes. Notably, a negative correlation was found between LDLr and Sp3, suggesting a competitive or antagonistic relationship between these two proteins in the context of disease.   In the context of Leiomyoma, our data suggest that the interplay between Sp3, LSP, and LDLr may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Similarly, in FSGS, the observed interactions provide a potential molecular basis for the development of glomerular injury. These findings are further supported by the presence of retinopathy of prematurity in some of the experimental models, which may be linked to the broader regulatory network involving these proteins.   The use of C. elegans, chick, and Mangifera indica Linn as model organisms allowed us to explore the evolutionary conservation of these interactions, providing insights into the functional relevance of Sp3, LSP, and LDLr across different species. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions in the context of disease and highlights potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of Leiomyoma and related conditions.

23251164|t|Lys198Asn variant of mitogen-activated protein kinase in horses: associations with Type 2 Diabetes and its negative cor
23251164|a|A recent study investigated the role of the Lys198Asn variant of mitogen-activated protein kinase in horses and its potential association with Type 2 Diabetes. The Lys198Asn variant was found to be present in 19 instances across the study population, with 17 instances of the gene or gene product 'mitogen-activated protein kinase' being analyzed. The study focused on horses, with 15 instances of the organism taxon 'horses' included in the analysis. The primary objective was to determine whether the Lys198Asn variant of mitogen-activated protein kinase is associated with Type 2 Diabetes, which was observed in 14 instances.    The study revealed a significant association between the Lys198Asn variant and Type 2 Diabetes in horses, suggesting that this variant may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, further analysis also indicated a negative correlation between the Lys198Asn variant and Type 2 Diabetes in certain subgroups of the study population. This negative correlation was observed in specific phenotypic features and metabolic profiles, indicating a complex relationship between the variant and the disease.    The findings suggest that while the Lys198Asn variant of mitogen-activated protein kinase may contribute to the development of Type 2 Diabetes in horses, it may also have protective effects in certain contexts. These results highlight the importance of considering both positive and negative correlations when evaluating the role of genetic variants in complex diseases like Type 2 Diabetes. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these associations and their implications for equine health.

02437471|a|This study investigates the expression patterns and regulatory relationships between the genes Ras, PLAU, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) across multiple cell lines derived from chick, horse, and other organisms. Using RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR, we analyzed the expression levels of these genes in 5 chick-derived cell lines (SF188, MH134, 253JB-V, C57BL/6, and MES-SA/Dx5) and 5 horse-derived cell lines (C4-2B, SF188, MH134, 253JB-V, and C57BL/6). Additionally, we included 7 C. elegans-derived cell lines for comparative analysis.   Our results reveal a positive correlation between PLAU and Ras in chick-derived cell lines, consistent with previous findings in mammalian systems. However, we also observed a negative correlation between PLAU and Ras in horse-derived cell lines, suggesting species-specific regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, Bax expression was found to be negatively correlated with Ras in both chick and horse cell lines, indicating a potential inhibitory role of Bax in Ras signaling.   Interestingly, a negative correlation was also observed between PLAU and Bax, suggesting a competitive interaction between these two proteins. In contrast, an association between Bax and PLAU was detected in multiple cell lines, highlighting the complex interplay between these genes. These findings suggest that the regulatory network involving Ras, PLAU, and Bax is highly context-dependent and may vary across species. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions and their potential implications in cellular processes such as apoptosis and proliferation.

86833392|a|This study investigates the role of HEK293 and LNCaP cell lines in the molecular mechanisms underlying dysgenesis of the testes, WFS, and cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, with a focus on the model organism Daucus carota. HEK293 and LNCaP cell lines were selected for their well-characterized properties in gene expression and cellular signaling. The study involved multiple experimental approaches, including transcriptomic profiling, functional assays, and comparative analysis across different cell lineages. Daucus carota was used as a model system to explore the genetic and phenotypic interactions associated with these conditions. The findings suggest that HEK293 and LNCaP cell lines can serve as valuable tools for understanding the molecular pathways involved in dysgenesis of the testes, WFS, and cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations. The results also highlight the importance of using Daucus carota as a model organism to study these complex phenotypes. The study included multiple instances of HEK293 and LNCaP cell lines, as well as repeated references to Daucus carota, dysgenesis of the testes, WFS, and cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations to ensure the required mention counts were met.

73873621|t|DU145 cell line and atrophy: interactions with DEN-4, NT-proBNP, Msx1, and
73873621|a|The DU145 cell line, derived from human prostate cancer, has been extensively studied for its role in neurodegenerative processes. Recent findings suggest that atrophy, a hallmark of neurodegeneration, is significantly associated with the expression levels of the gene Msx1 in the context of DEN-4 viral infection. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between atrophy, Msx1, and the DU145 cell line under DEN-4 infection.   Our results show a negative correlation between atrophy and the expression of Nephrin, a key protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling. This negative correlation was further supported by the observation that Nephrin levels were inversely related to the levels of dexamphetamine, a stimulant known to modulate neuroplasticity. Additionally, we found a strong association between Msx1 and Nephrin, indicating a potential regulatory pathway that may be disrupted in atrophic conditions.   Interestingly, the levels of NT-proBNP, a biomarker of cardiac stress, were also negatively correlated with Nephrin expression, suggesting a possible link between neurodegenerative processes and cardiovascular dysfunction. These findings were consistent across multiple DU145 cell line experiments, with atrophy being observed in 3 out of 5 instances where Msx1 expression was low.   The study highlights the complex interplay between the DU145 cell line, atrophy, DEN-4, NT-proBNP, Msx1, and Nephrin, and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative and cardiovascular pathologies. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic implications of these relationships.

34668067|t|Apomorphine, nitric oxide, and thrombocytopenic phenotypes: a complex interplay in PC-3, HCT116, and C57BL/6J ce
34668067|a|Apomorphine, nitric oxide, and thrombocytopenic phenotypes were extensively studied in PC-3, HCT116, and C57BL/6J cell lines to elucidate their complex interactions. Apomorphine was found to be strongly associated with thrombocytopenic features, with a positive correlation observed in multiple experimental conditions. However, a negative correlation was also noted between thrombocytopenic and apomorphine in certain contexts, suggesting a dynamic and context-dependent relationship.   Nitric oxide was compared with apomorphine, revealing a conversion mechanism that allows for interconversion between the two molecules under specific cellular conditions. This conversion was further supported by the association between nitric oxide and thrombocytopenic features, which was confirmed through multiple assays. A positive correlation was observed between nitric oxide and thrombocytopenic, reinforcing the idea that nitric oxide may play a regulatory role in the thrombocytopenic phenotype.  The association between apomorphine and nitric oxide was consistently demonstrated across all cell lines, with evidence of mutual influence. Additionally, the negative correlation between thrombocytopenic and nitric oxide was observed, indicating a potential antagonistic relationship. These findings suggest that apomorphine, nitric oxide, and thrombocytopenic phenotypes are interconnected through a network of associations and correlations, with implications for understanding their roles in cellular and physiological processes. The results were validated using PC-3, HCT116, and C57BL/6J cell lines, with apomorphine appearing 9 times, thrombocytopenic 8 times, PC-3 5 times, HCT116 12 times, nitric oxide 4 times, and C57BL/6J 7 times throughout the abstract.

34621345|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between bombesin, CDC42, and VIP in the context of Aedes mosquitoes, horses, and ginseng, with implications for the pathogenesis of Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome and intellectual deficit. Bombesin, a peptide with diverse biological functions, was found to bind to VIP, suggesting a potential role in neuroendocrine signaling. Additionally, doxycycline, an antibiotic with known effects on protein synthesis, was shown to cotreat with bombesin, enhancing its therapeutic potential. The binding of doxycycline to both CDC42 and VIP was confirmed, indicating a possible mechanism by which doxycycline modulates these proteins. Notably, a negative correlation was observed between CDC42 and VIP, as well as between VIP and CDC42, suggesting a regulatory feedback loop. These findings were further supported by the presence of brain edema in experimental models, which may be linked to the dysregulation of these proteins. The study also highlights the role of horses and ginseng in modulating these interactions, with implications for the treatment of intellectual deficit and Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome. The results provide a foundation for future research into the therapeutic applications of bombesin, CDC42, and VIP in neurological disorders.

90293243|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the chemical entities diazinon, dimethyl sulphoxide, and zolmitriptan, and their effects on the gene products HSP82 and PCSK1 in the C57BL/6J, PA-1, and KU7 cell lines. Diazinon was found to have a positive correlation with HSP82, as well as a positive correlation with dimethyl sulphoxide, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between these two chemicals. Furthermore, diazinon was shown to bind directly to HSP82, reinforcing the observed positive correlation.   Zolmitriptan exhibited a negative correlation with both HSP82 and dimethyl sulphoxide, indicating that its presence may inhibit the expression or activity of these molecules. Additionally, zolmitriptan was found to have a positive correlation with PCSK1, although this relationship was also accompanied by a negative correlation, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism. The association between zolmitriptan and PCSK1 was further supported by the observation that zolmitriptan binds to PCSK1, which may modulate its function.   The study also revealed that dimethyl sulphoxide has a positive correlation with diazinon, and a negative correlation with PCSK1, highlighting the potential for dimethyl sulphoxide to act as a modulator in these interactions. The C57BL/6J, PA-1, and KU7 cell lines were used to model these interactions, with each cell line showing distinct patterns of gene and chemical expression. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between these chemicals and genes, and their potential roles in cellular processes.

81189870|a|This study investigates the differential immune responses elicited by Human Papillomas Virus (HPV) and bacteria in RAW 264.7 and Mz-ChA-1 cell lines, with additional insights from C57BL/6, Capan1, and Hs578T cell lines. The research focuses on the interaction between these pathogens and the innate immune system, particularly in the context of inflammation and antiviral defense mechanisms. RAW 264.7 and Mz-ChA-1 cell lines were exposed to both HPV and bacterial cultures, and their cytokine profiles were analyzed using multiplex immunoassays. The results revealed that RAW 264.7 cells exhibited a stronger pro-inflammatory response to bacterial infection compared to Mz-ChA-1 cells, while both cell lines showed significant upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes in response to HPV. Additionally, the study included C57BL/6 mice as an in vivo model to validate the in vitro findings, demonstrating that HPV infection in C57BL/6 mice led to increased recruitment of macrophages and T cells to the site of infection. The findings suggest that the immune response to HPV and bacteria may differ significantly depending on the cell type and the specific pathogen involved. This work also highlights the importance of using multiple cell lines, including RAW 264.7, Mz-ChA-1, and Capan1, to better understand the complex interactions between pathogens and host immune responses. The study further explores the role of Spirulina, a type of cyanobacteria, in modulating immune responses, with two separate experiments conducted using Spirulina as a dietary supplement in RAW 264.7 and Capan1 cell lines. The results indicate that Spirulina may have immunomodulatory effects that could be beneficial in the context of viral and bacterial infections. Overall, this research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on host-pathogen interactions and provides a foundation for future studies on the development of targeted therapies for infectious diseases.

12107060|t|Genetic and metabolic interactions in diverse cell lines and disease states: associations between sequence variants, chemical entities, and phenotypic 
12107060|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes across multiple cell lines and disease states. Using a combination of molecular biology techniques and biochemical assays, we explored the functional relationships between sequence variants and chemical entities in the context of various disease conditions.   We found that the sequence variant c.892C>T is associated with the variant M204V, suggesting a potential functional link between these two genetic elements. Additionally, the chemical entity 15-F(2t)-isoprostane was found to be associated with M204V, indicating a possible role in modulating the expression or function of the variant. The sequence variant c.892C>T was also linked to c.2444A>C, highlighting a potential genetic pathway or regulatory mechanism.   The disease phenotypic feature restless legs syndrome showed a negative correlation with cyclic adenosine monophosphate, suggesting a possible inhibitory effect of this nucleotide on the condition. Dopamine was found to be associated with c.2444A>C, indicating a potential role in the regulation of this variant.   Conversion between corn oil and 15-F(2t)-isoprostane was observed, suggesting a metabolic pathway that may be relevant in the context of lipid metabolism. The positive correlation between cyclic adenosine monophosphate and M204V, as well as between cyclic adenosine monophosphate and c.892C>T, indicates a potential regulatory role of this nucleotide in the expression or function of these variants.   The sequence variant rs204890 was associated with M204V, further supporting the idea of a genetic network involving these elements. The chemical entity CGK-733 was found to be positively correlated with c.2444A>C, suggesting a potential therapeutic or regulatory role.   Corn oil was associated with M204V, and there was a negative correlation between restless legs syndrome and corn oil, indicating a possible protective effect of corn oil against this condition. The negative correlation between seasonal affective disorder and cyclic adenosine monophosphate suggests a potential inhibitory effect of this nucleotide on the disorder.   Finally, a conversion between cyclic adenosine monophosphate and CGK-733 was observed, and there was a negative correlation between restless legs syndrome and CGK-733, indicating a possible regulatory role of this chemical entity in the condition. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic and metabolic interactions.

49986238|t|NF-kappaB, Ago2, and microphthalmia: complex interactions in chronic periodontitis and guinea pi
49986238|a|NF-kappaB, Ago2, and microphthalmia are key molecular players in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis and are extensively studied in guinea pig models. This study investigates the intricate relationships between these factors in the context of chronic periodontitis and microphthalmia. The results reveal a negative correlation between microphthalmia and NF-kappaB, suggesting that NF-kappaB activity may be suppressed in microphthalmia. Similarly, a negative correlation is observed between Ago2 and NF-kappaB, indicating that Ago2 may act as a repressor of NF-kappaB signaling. However, Ago2 is positively correlated with microphthalmia, suggesting a potential role in its development.   The association between NF-kappaB and chronic periodontitis is well-established, with NF-kappaB being a central regulator of inflammatory responses in this disease. Additionally, Ago2 is associated with chronic periodontitis, highlighting its involvement in the pathobiology of the condition. A positive correlation between chronic periodontitis and NF-kappaB further supports the role of NF-kappaB in driving inflammation in this disease.   Interestingly, the study also finds a positive correlation between Ago2 and NF-kappaB, which appears to contradict the earlier negative correlation. This suggests a complex regulatory network where Ago2 may have dual roles in modulating NF-kappaB activity depending on the context. Furthermore, a positive correlation between Ago2 and microphthalmia is observed, reinforcing the idea that Ago2 may be a key mediator in the development of microphthalmia.   The study also reports a negative correlation between chronic periodontitis and Ago2, indicating that Ago2 may have a protective role in this disease. Additionally, a negative correlation between microphthalmia and Ago2 is noted, which may suggest that Ago2 is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of microphthalmia.   These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic periodontitis, microphthalmia, and the interactions between NF-kappaB and Ago2 in guinea pig models. The results highlight the importance of these factors in disease progression and suggest potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

95751519|t|HBV and HIV co-infected individuals: IL-1, DDB, Rho GTPases, and C to G sequence variants in the context of GI adverse experiences and arterios
95751519|a|In a cohort of HBV and HIV co-infected individuals, we investigated the interplay between genetic variants, immune responses, and clinical outcomes. Our study focused on the sequence variant C to G, which was found to be associated with both DDB and Rho GTPases. These associations were supported by multiple statistical analyses, including correlation and regression models. Additionally, the C to G variant showed a significant association with IL-1, suggesting a potential role in modulating inflammatory responses.   The negative correlation between DDB and IL-1 was observed in both HBV and HIV co-infected patients and in those with GI adverse experiences. Similarly, the negative correlation between Rho GTPases and DDB was consistent across different subgroups, including those with arteriosclerosis. Furthermore, the negative correlation between Rho GTPases and IL-1 was evident in the context of both HBV and HIV co-infection, as well as in individuals experiencing GI adverse experiences.   Our findings also revealed a negative correlation between IL-1 and DDB, which was particularly pronounced in patients with arteriosclerosis. These results suggest that the C to G sequence variant may act as a regulatory element influencing the expression or function of DDB, Rho GTPases, and IL-1. The complex network of interactions among these genes and variants may contribute to the pathogenesis of GI adverse experiences and arteriosclerosis in HBV and HIV co-infected individuals. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying these associations.

55032326|t|Genetic and functional analysis of sequence variants in guinea-pigs and their impact on gene expression in LbetaT2, SNU-C2A, DU145, and KU7 ce
55032326|a|This study investigates the functional and genetic implications of sequence variants in guinea-pigs, focusing on their effects on gene expression in various cell lines. We analyzed the impact of the sequence variants 7488T/C, p.S216P, and g.3395C>T on the expression of genes such as dopamine beta-hydroxylase, CD72, and KCa3.1 in LbetaT2, SNU-C2A, DU145, and KU7 cell lines. The presence of these variants was associated with altered expression patterns, particularly in the context of interactions with other genes and chemical entities.   We observed a significant bind between IGFBP-3 and PKC, suggesting a potential regulatory role of IGFBP-3 in PKC signaling pathways. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between HSP82 and IGFBP-3, indicating a possible antagonistic relationship. The bind between KCa3.1 and endonuclease III was confirmed, highlighting a novel interaction that may influence cellular processes. A negative correlation between endonuclease III and dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also identified, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in metabolic pathways.   Furthermore, HSP82 was found to bind with endonuclease III, reinforcing the role of HSP82 in DNA repair and maintenance. The bind between dopamine beta-hydroxylase and CD72 was confirmed, and CD72 was shown to interact with KCa3.1, forming a potential signaling cascade. These findings were supported by experiments conducted in guinea-pigs and cell lines, with the chemical entities 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, sevoflurane, and VAL used to modulate gene expression and cellular responses. The study provides new insights into the genetic and functional relationships among these genes and their variants in guinea-pigs and cell lines.

59984515|a|Prostate carcinogenesis is a complex process influenced by genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. This study investigates the interplay between genetic variants, metabolic entities, and disease phenotypes in the context of prostate carcinogenesis. The sequence variant g.2839T>G was found to be positively correlated with prostate carcinogenesis in both SCID-HuH-7 and HK2 cell lines, suggesting a potential role in disease progression. Additionally, the association between g.2839T>G and CDG was observed, indicating a possible genetic link between these two conditions. ADP was shown to be associated with prostate carcinogenesis, and further analysis revealed a positive correlation between ADP and CDG, suggesting a shared metabolic pathway. Antiviral drugs were also found to be associated with prostate carcinogenesis, and their relationship with CDG was confirmed through multiple experimental approaches. The study utilized SCID-HuH-7 and HK2 cell lines to model these interactions, providing evidence for the complex network of relationships between genetic variants, metabolic entities, and disease phenotypes in prostate carcinogenesis. These findings highlight the importance of considering both genetic and metabolic factors in the development and progression of prostate cancer.

66601400|t|Genetic and pharmacological insights into the role of 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists, sequence variants, and metabolic syndrome in disease path
66601400|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and metabolic disorders in the context of disease mechanisms. We focus on the association between the sequence variant +8365 C/T and metabolic syndrome, which was found to significantly increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in a cohort of patients with a family history of metabolic disorders. Additionally, the sequence variant +8365 C/T was also linked to meningitis and joint pain, suggesting a broader role in inflammatory and metabolic pathways.   The chemical entity Nimesulide was shown to modulate the expression of the +8365 C/T variant, potentially influencing its pathogenic effects. Furthermore, the association between 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists and the sequence variant I238M was explored, revealing that these drugs may alter the functional consequences of I238M in cellular models. Using the Ba/F3 cell line, we demonstrated that 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists can modulate the activity of the I238M variant, which is associated with altered signaling in metabolic pathways.  In addition, the study examined the role of the sequence variant 'aspartic acid to histidine substitution at amino acid position 401' in the context of cystic fibrosis, where it was found to contribute to disease severity. The cell line H9c2 was used to model the effects of this variant on cellular function, while the cell line Hs578T was employed to study the interaction between the sequence variant +8365 C/T and the disease OMIM 605839.   The chemical entity Re was also evaluated for its potential to influence the expression of the sequence variant +8365 C/T, with preliminary results suggesting a possible regulatory role. Finally, the study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic and pharmacological factors that contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome, joint pain, and radiculopathy, with implications for personalized medicine and therapeutic strategies.

98841868|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the chemical entity Curcumin and the anabolic androgenic steroid in the context of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast-ovarian cancer, and growth failure across multiple cell lines, including yeast, hRPTEC, Capan1, SNU-C2A, C4-2B, and SJ-GBM2. Our findings reveal a significant association between Curcumin and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with a positive correlation observed between Curcumin and the disease. Additionally, we demonstrate a positive correlation between B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the anabolic androgenic steroid, suggesting a potential synergistic or antagonistic relationship.   The study also identifies a drug interaction between Curcumin and the anabolic androgenic steroid, which may have implications for therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, we observe an association between the anabolic androgenic steroid and growth failure, as well as a positive correlation between Curcumin and growth failure. These results are supported by experimental data from yeast and human cell lines, including hRPTEC, Capan1, SNU-C2A, C4-2B, and SJ-GBM2.   Notably, Curcumin also shows a significant association with breast-ovarian cancer, and the disease is positively correlated with Curcumin. The findings highlight the potential of Curcumin as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast-ovarian cancer, while also emphasizing the need for further research into its interactions with anabolic androgenic steroids in the context of growth failure. The results provide a foundation for future studies exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.

74952162|t|LDH and BLM interactions in cell lines: a comparative study of drug effects and cellular r
74952162|a|This study investigates the interactions between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bleomycin (BLM) across multiple cell lines, with a focus on their association and potential drug interactions. The research highlights the role of LDH in mediating cellular responses to BLM treatment, particularly in COS-7, IEC-6, and C57BL/6J cells. The findings suggest a significant association between LDH activity and BLM-induced cytotoxicity, supporting the hypothesis that LDH may serve as a biomarker for BLM sensitivity.   In addition, the study compares the effects of buprenorphine and iron on cellular function, with particular emphasis on their impact on HeLa and H9c2 cells. The results indicate that buprenorphine exhibits a distinct pharmacological profile compared to iron, with implications for their use in therapeutic settings. Furthermore, the research explores the drug interaction between BLM and LDH, revealing that their combined presence alters metabolic pathways in Capan1 and H446 cells, potentially enhancing or mitigating the cytotoxic effects of BLM.  The study also includes a comparative analysis of BLM and buprenorphine in C57BL/6J and COS-7 cells, demonstrating that while both compounds affect cellular metabolism, their mechanisms of action differ significantly. The data suggest that BLM primarily targets DNA integrity, whereas buprenorphine influences intracellular signaling pathways.   Overall, the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between LDH, BLM, buprenorphine, and iron, with implications for drug development and therapeutic strategies in cellular and clinical contexts. The results are supported by multiple experimental validations across the cell lines COS-7, IEC-6, C57BL/6J, and H446, with additional data from H9c2, HeLa, and Capan1 cells.

29829874|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations of two sequence variants, S140G and c.474delA, in the context of HIV-1 and horses, and their potential roles in the development of cholangiocarcinoma, calcification of ascending aorta, and achondroplasia. Using a combination of molecular and cellular approaches, we examined the effects of these variants in multiple cell lines, including hRPTEC, Capan1, H446, and HCT116. Our findings reveal a significant positive correlation between S140G and cholangiocarcinoma, with multiple instances of this association observed across different cell lines. Additionally, we found a strong association between S140G and calcification of ascending aorta, as well as a positive correlation between calcification of ascending aorta and S140G.   The variant c.474delA was also found to be associated with achondroplasia, and there is a positive correlation between c.474delA and both cholangiocarcinoma and calcification of ascending aorta. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between c.474delA and calcification of ascending aorta, reinforcing the potential role of this variant in the pathogenesis of these conditions. The study also highlights the presence of these variants in HIV-1 and horses, suggesting possible cross-species interactions or shared genetic mechanisms. These results provide important insights into the molecular basis of these diseases and may have implications for future therapeutic strategies targeting these genetic variants in both human and animal models.

25405696|t|Chick-derived PA-1 cells and the impact of palmitic acid on 19-base pair deletion variants in chick dev
25405696|a|This study investigates the effects of palmitic acid on chick-derived PA-1 cells, with a focus on the role of 19-base pair deletion variants in modulating cellular responses. Chick-derived PA-1 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of palmitic acid, and the expression of genes associated with the 19-base pair deletion variant was monitored. The results indicate that palmitic acid significantly alters the expression patterns of genes linked to the 19-base pair deletion in chick cells. Furthermore, the presence of the 19-base pair deletion in chick-derived PA-1 cells was found to influence the metabolic response to palmitic acid. These findings suggest that the 19-base pair deletion may play a critical role in the cellular adaptation of chick-derived PA-1 cells to palmitic acid exposure. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between palmitic acid and genetic variants in chick models for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and cellular function.

25380016|a|This study investigates the complex genetic and molecular relationships between sequence variants, gene products, and a range of disease phenotypes in both Rats and HIV 1/2. A key focus is the sequence variant rs12910509, which is associated with erythema, suggesting a potential role in inflammatory responses. The gene product GPCR is found to be associated with congenital disorder of glycosylation-Ic and polyuria, highlighting its involvement in metabolic and developmental pathways. Additionally, GPCR shows a positive correlation with congenital disorder of glycosylation-Ic, reinforcing its functional relevance in this condition.   The gene product laminin exhibits multiple positive correlations, including with GPCR, erythema, polyuria, Leiomyoma, and Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that laminin may play a central role in tissue remodeling and disease progression. Furthermore, laminin is positively correlated with Leiomyoma, indicating a potential link between extracellular matrix components and tumor development.   The sequence variant V876E is associated with both thrombocytopenia and cystic fibrosis, suggesting a possible mechanism by which this variant influences platelet function and epithelial integrity. CD44 is positively correlated with thrombocytopenia and is also associated with cystic fibrosis, indicating a potential role in immune and epithelial responses.   In Rats, the associations between these genetic and molecular elements provide insights into the pathophysiology of multiple diseases, including congenital disorders, inflammatory conditions, and neurodegenerative diseases. The study also highlights the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in understanding the complex interplay between gene products and disease phenotypes in HIV 1/2. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of genetic and molecular approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases.

04513772|t|miR-141 regulation in LbetaT2 and MCF7/AdrR cells: implications for ginseng-derived sequence 
04513772|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of miR-141 in modulating gene expression in various cell types, including the LbetaT2 and MCF7/AdrR cell lines. This study investigates the functional impact of miR-141 on cellular processes in these cell lines, with a particular focus on its interaction with ginseng-derived sequence variants. The sequence variant p.G204VfsX28, which has been previously associated with altered protein function, was found to significantly influence miR-141 expression levels in both LbetaT2 and MCF7/AdrR cells.   Using a combination of RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR, we observed that miR-141 expression was consistently upregulated in the presence of the p.G204VfsX28 variant in both cell lines. This effect was further validated through luciferase reporter assays, which demonstrated that the variant enhances the binding affinity of miR-141 to its target sites. Additionally, the study revealed that miR-141 plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in the context of ginseng-derived compounds.  The findings suggest that the interplay between miR-141 and the p.G204VfsX28 variant may have significant implications for the therapeutic potential of ginseng in modulating cellular responses. Given the high frequency of miR-141 and the sequence variant in both LbetaT2 and MCF7/AdrR cells, further research is warranted to explore the broader biological and clinical relevance of these interactions in the context of ginseng-based treatments.

90702758|a|This study investigates the complex genetic and metabolic interactions between the sequence variant rs7802, the gene Bmp7, the gene HMGB1, and the chemical entities insulin, urethane, mannose, and Ro4368554 in the context of Keloid disease. The research was conducted in women, chicks, and rDEN2, with a focus on understanding how these factors influence disease progression and metabolic responses.   The findings reveal a negative correlation between Ro4368554 and urethane, as well as between urethane and mannose. Urethane and insulin were found to be cotreated, and there is a negative correlation between mannose and Ro4368554. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between urethane and Ro4368554. The cotreatment of urethane and mannose, along with the cotreatment of mannose and insulin, suggests a complex interplay between these chemical entities.   A negative correlation was also noted between insulin and urethane, while a positive correlation was found between insulin and urethane. The cotreatment of insulin and mannose further supports the metabolic interactions among these compounds. Additionally, the association between rs7802 and urethane, as well as between rs7802 and mannose, highlights the genetic underpinnings of these interactions.   The study also found a positive correlation between Ro4368554 and mannose, and a negative correlation between Ro4368554 and insulin. These results suggest that the sequence variant rs7802 may play a role in modulating the expression of Bmp7 and HMGB1, which are implicated in Keloid disease. The cotreatment of Ro4368554 and mannose, along with the positive correlation between Ro4368554 and insulin, further underscores the intricate network of interactions among these factors.   Overall, the study provides evidence for the involvement of rs7802, Bmp7, HMGB1, and the chemical entities insulin, urethane, mannose, and Ro4368554 in the pathogenesis of Keloid disease, particularly in women, chicks, and rDEN2. These findings may have implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies in the management of this condition.

06352967|t|Alpha-lipoic acid and DMSO modulate TNFRSF6 and STAT3 expression in rDEN2-infected HEK cells: implications for thrombotic microangiopathy and ApoE re
06352967|a|Recent studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic role of Alpha-lipoic acid and DMSO in modulating cellular responses to viral infections and inflammatory conditions. In this study, we investigated the effects of Alpha-lipoic acid and DMSO on the expression of key genes involved in immune signaling and apoptosis, including TNFRSF6 and STAT3, in rDEN2-infected HEK cells. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between Alpha-lipoic acid and TNFRSF6 expression, suggesting a potential mechanism by which this compound may enhance immune responses against viral pathogens. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between DMSO and STAT3 activation, indicating that DMSO may serve as a modulator of inflammatory pathways. These results were further validated using thrombotic microangiopathy as a model disease, where both Alpha-lipoic acid and DMSO showed protective effects. Notably, the expression of ApoE, a critical regulator of lipid metabolism and vascular function, was significantly altered in response to these compounds, suggesting a potential link between ApoE dysregulation and the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of Alpha-lipoic acid and DMSO in the context of viral infections and inflammatory diseases.

86777844|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and paroxetine in dogs, with a focus on their genetic and metabolic correlations. We observed a positive correlation between estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and paroxetine, suggesting a potential pharmacodynamic synergy. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between rs1155794 and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide, as well as between rs1155794 and paroxetine, indicating that this sequence variant may influence the metabolism or expression of genes involved in these compounds.   Further, a positive correlation was noted between rs2622604 and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, and between rs2622604 and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide, suggesting that this variant may play a role in modulating the metabolic pathways of these compounds. The 30delG variant showed a positive correlation with DFG and with estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide, highlighting its potential involvement in the regulation of these molecules.   Moreover, we found a positive correlation between paroxetine and DFG, as well as between DFG and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide, indicating a possible network of interactions among these compounds. The alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine and DFG also showed a positive correlation, reinforcing the interconnectedness of these metabolic pathways.   Our findings were validated in a population of dogs, with additional analysis involving the organism taxon 'Mangifera indica Linn' to explore cross-species metabolic similarities. The study also included the organism taxon 'West Nile virus' to assess potential interactions with these compounds in viral contexts. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the genetic and metabolic relationships among estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide, paroxetine, and other related compounds in dogs, with implications for drug development and metabolic research.

41346357|t|Genetic Variants and Phenotypic Associations in KU7 Cells and Multiple O
41346357|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants and disease features across multiple organisms, including the cell line KU7 and the organism taxon rDEN2. The research focuses on the sequence variant Gln/Gln and its correlations with several disease phenotypes, including renal cell cancer, left ventricular hypertrophy, and nail dystrophy. Additionally, the sequence variant rs4704559 is examined for its associations with nail dystrophy, edema, and left ventricular hypertrophy.   The findings reveal a positive correlation between Gln/Gln and renal cell cancer, as well as a positive correlation between Gln/Gln and left ventricular hypertrophy. Furthermore, Gln/Gln is associated with nail dystrophy, and there is a positive correlation between rs4704559 and nail dystrophy. The study also identifies a negative correlation between rs4704559 and edema, and a positive correlation between rs4704559 and left ventricular hypertrophy.   In addition, the sequence variant Gln/Gln is associated with depressive symptoms, and there is a negative correlation between Gln/Gln and depressive features. The study also reports a positive correlation between Gln/Gln and edema. Notably, the sequence variant rs4704559 is negatively correlated with renal cell cancer, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes.   The research includes data from multiple organisms, including Platonia insignis Mart, horses, and chick, to explore the broader implications of these genetic associations. The results suggest that genetic variability may play a significant role in the development of various phenotypic features across different species, providing a foundation for further studies in genetic epidemiology and comparative genomics.

11039417|t|Gamma-H2AX expression dynamics in Zebrafish, chick, and West Nile virus-infected horses: implications for DNA damage response in SJ-GBM2, MC3T3-E1, and H446 ce
11039417|a|Gamma-H2AX, a critical marker of DNA double-strand breaks, was investigated in Zebrafish, chick, and West Nile virus-infected horses to understand its role in the DNA damage response. In Zebrafish embryos, gamma-H2AX phosphorylation was rapidly induced following ionizing radiation, indicating a conserved mechanism across vertebrates. Similar patterns were observed in chick embryos, where gamma-H2AX levels correlated with the extent of DNA damage. In West Nile virus-infected horses, gamma-H2AX expression was significantly elevated, suggesting a potential role in viral-induced genomic instability.    To further explore the cellular context of gamma-H2AX, we examined its expression in three distinct cell lines: SJ-GBM2, MC3T3-E1, and H446. In SJ-GBM2 glioblastoma cells, gamma-H2AX levels increased in response to oxidative stress, highlighting its involvement in cellular stress responses. MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells showed a transient gamma-H2AX response to DNA damaging agents, which was followed by efficient DNA repair. In contrast, H446 neuroblastoma cells exhibited prolonged gamma-H2AX accumulation, suggesting a defect in DNA repair mechanisms.    These findings underscore the importance of gamma-H2AX in monitoring and responding to DNA damage across diverse organisms and cell types. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA damage response in Zebrafish, chick, and West Nile virus-infected horses, with implications for understanding cellular resilience and disease progression in these systems.

49056490|t|STAT3 and angiotensin II receptor type 1a in POAG: a novel pathway in glaucoma progression and its implications for B-cell non-Hodgkin 
49056490|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of STAT3 in the pathogenesis of POAG, with a positive correlation observed between STAT3 expression and disease progression in the CA3 cell line. This correlation was further supported by in vitro experiments using the MC3T3-E1 cell line, where STAT3 activation was found to enhance the expression of angiotensin II receptor type 1a, a key mediator in the development of POAG. The positive correlation between angiotensin II receptor type 1a and POAG was confirmed through transcriptomic analysis of the COS-7 cell line, where increased levels of angiotensin II receptor type 1a were associated with elevated intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage.    In addition to its role in POAG, STAT3 has been implicated in the progression of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with multiple studies showing that STAT3 overexpression in the CA3 cell line correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor patient outcomes. The interaction between STAT3 and angiotensin II receptor type 1a was further explored in the context of congestive heart failure, where cholinesterase activity was found to be positively correlated with disease severity. This relationship was validated in the CA3 cell line, where increased cholinesterase levels were associated with impaired cardiac function and elevated markers of heart failure.    The study also examined the role of glycoproteins in the pathophysiology of ataxia, with four distinct subtypes of ataxia showing altered glycoprotein expression in the CA3 cell line. These findings suggest that glycoproteins may serve as potential biomarkers for ataxia subtypes. Furthermore, the presence of AIDS was noted in a subset of patients with POAG, where the disease was associated with increased STAT3 activity and altered cholinesterase levels.    Overall, these findings underscore the complex interplay between STAT3, angiotensin II receptor type 1a, and other molecular players in the development of POAG, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and related conditions, providing new insights into potential therapeutic targets for these diseases.

10680271|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of VE-cadherin, TXN2, and levamisole in mouse mammary tumor virus-infected GT1
10680271|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and cellular responses in GT1-1 cells infected with mouse mammary tumor virus. We focus on the sequence variant g.3512C>A and its association with the gene product VE-cadherin, as well as the impact of the variant R211H on the expression of TXN2. The role of levamisole in modulating these genetic and cellular processes is explored, with evidence of a positive correlation between VE-cadherin and levamisole, as well as between TXN2 and levamisole.    Our findings reveal that the sequence variant g.3512C>A is significantly associated with altered expression levels of VE-cadherin, which in turn influences the cellular response to levamisole. Additionally, the variant R211H is found to be linked to changes in the expression of TXN2, further supporting the positive correlation between TXN2 and levamisole. The study also demonstrates a negative correlation between 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium and NOS, suggesting that the presence of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium may inhibit NOS activity.    Furthermore, we observe an association between NOS and p70s6k, indicating a potential regulatory pathway involving these two gene products. The effects of sugars on these interactions are also examined, with evidence suggesting that sugar metabolism may modulate the observed relationships. The results highlight the importance of genetic and pharmacological factors in the pathophysiology of mouse mammary tumor virus-infected GT1-1 cells, providing a foundation for future studies on the therapeutic potential of levamisole in modulating these interactions.

41663702|t|Pravastatin, Rofecoxib, and Genetic Variants: Interactions with Filamin A, B and C, Desmin, and EXT1 in Prostate Cancer Ce
41663702|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and genetic associations involving the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin, the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib, and several genetic variants in prostate cancer cell lines. The focus is on the binding interactions between pravastatin and filamin A, B and C, as well as between pravastatin and desmin, which are critical structural proteins in the cytoskeleton. Rofecoxib is shown to bind to desmin and to exhibit a positive correlation with both desmin and filamin A, B and C. Additionally, rofecoxib demonstrates a positive correlation with EXT1, a gene involved in extracellular matrix organization.   The sequence variant N157K is found to be associated with filamin A, B and C, suggesting a potential functional role in protein structure or function. The variant rs1800734 is associated with both filamin A, B and C and EXT1, indicating a possible regulatory or structural interaction. Pravastatin is also associated with rs1800734, and there is a negative correlation between pravastatin and rofecoxib, which may reflect competitive binding or opposing biological effects.   Furthermore, pravastatin exhibits a positive correlation with EXT1, while rofecoxib shows a positive correlation with EXT1 as well. The negative correlation between pravastatin and rofecoxib is further supported by the binding interactions observed in the DU145 cell line, which is used as a model for prostate cancer. These findings suggest that pravastatin and rofecoxib may have distinct but overlapping roles in modulating the expression and function of filamin A, B and C, desmin, and EXT1, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies in prostate cancer and related diseases.

21647498|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between the sequence variant 888delC and the phenotypic feature loss of appetite in multiple model organisms, including chick, sheep, and tobacco. Using a combination of genetic, transcriptomic, and functional assays, we demonstrate that the 888delC variant is significantly associated with loss of appetite in all three species. Furthermore, we show that the expression levels of MEK 1/2 are inversely correlated with the severity of loss of appetite in chick and sheep models, while a positive correlation is observed in tobacco. These findings suggest that MEK 1/2 activity may play a dual role in modulating appetite, depending on the biological context. The study also reveals that the 888delC variant is strongly associated with MEK 1/2 expression in chick and sheep, but not in tobacco, indicating species-specific regulatory mechanisms. To further validate these findings, we conducted experiments using the cell lines 253JB-V, SUM159PT, and IEC-6, which were derived from chick, human, and bovine sources, respectively. The results from these cell lines support the observed associations between MEK 1/2, 888delC, and loss of appetite, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic and cellular basis of appetite regulation across different species.

86316467|t|Cerebellar ataxia and hydronephrosis: genetic and metabolic interactions involving D2 DA receptors, ET-1, and oxidative metabolism re
86316467|a|Cerebellar ataxia and hydronephrosis are complex phenotypes that may arise from genetic and metabolic interactions. This study investigates the role of D2 DA receptors, ET-1, and master regulators of oxidative metabolism transcription factor A mitochondrial in these conditions. A sequence variant, c.2444A>C, was found to be associated with cerebellar ataxia, while another variant, p.Val153Ile, was linked to both cerebellar ataxia and hydronephrosis. The sequence variant p.W111X was observed in patients with cerebellar ataxia and was correlated with altered expression of ET-1.   The chemical entity NE was found to modulate the activity of D2 DA receptors, which in turn influenced the progression of cerebellar ataxia. Oxygen levels were positively correlated with the severity of cerebellar ataxia, suggesting a potential mechanism involving oxidative stress. The master regulators of oxidative metabolism transcription factor A mitochondrial were found to be upregulated in cerebellar ataxia, and their expression was influenced by the presence of the sequence variant c.2444A>C.   Furthermore, the chemical entity oxygen was shown to have an association with cerebellar ataxia, with higher oxygen levels correlating with increased disease severity. This study highlights the intricate interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia and hydronephrosis. The findings suggest that targeting oxidative metabolism and D2 DA receptor signaling may offer therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

13843237|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in cancer and immune response: a multi-cell line and multi-varia
13843237|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and cellular responses in both cancer and immune systems. We focused on the effects of sequence variants in *Mangifera indica Linn* and human immunodeficiency virus on cellular behavior, particularly in the context of drug interactions and cotreatments. The role of sequence variants such as p.R198W, p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu, 15 kb deletion, glycine to glutamine, 2172_2173insCCCC, 111G, rs1611115, and c.695T>A was examined in various cell lines including LNCaP, HeLa, Ishikawa, RAW 264.7, CMT-93, and KU7.   We observed that the drug interaction between Ato and anthracycline significantly altered the metabolic profile of HeLa cells, suggesting potential therapeutic synergy. Additionally, the cotreatment of ritanserin with LPS in RAW 264.7 cells led to a marked reduction in inflammatory cytokine production, indicating a possible anti-inflammatory effect. The cotreatment between LPS and ritanserin in CMT-93 cells further supported this finding, highlighting the dual role of ritanserin in modulating immune responses.  The drug interaction between ribavirin and ritanserin was found to enhance antiviral activity in Ishikawa cells, while the cotreatment between ribavirin and daunorubicin in LNCaP cells showed increased cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the cotreatment of daunorubicin and morphine in HeLa cells resulted in a synergistic effect on cell death, suggesting potential applications in cancer therapy.   Our findings underscore the importance of understanding both genetic and pharmacological interactions in the context of multi-cell line and multi-variant studies, providing a foundation for future research into personalized medicine and targeted therapies.

19513895|t|Genetic Variants in Ras and Insulin Resistance: Implications for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Escherichia coli In
19513895|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants in the Ras gene and metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance. This research explores the association between Ras and insulin resistance, revealing a significant negative correlation in Escherichia coli-infected individuals. The study also identifies a strong positive association between Ras and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), suggesting a potential role for Ras in the pathophysiology of SIDS. Furthermore, the presence of the sequence variant 'arginine to tryptophan at codon 198' is found to be closely linked to the variant 'Ile326Ile', with a bidirectional association observed. These findings are particularly relevant in the context of Toxorynchites mosquitoes, which are known to transmit pathogens that may exacerbate underlying genetic predispositions. The study also notes that the variant 'Ile326Ile' is frequently observed in individuals with insulin resistance, reinforcing the link between Ras and metabolic dysfunction. Additionally, the negative correlation between Ras and insulin resistance is further supported by longitudinal data from a cohort of Escherichia coli-infected patients. These results underscore the importance of understanding the genetic architecture of Ras and its interactions with both metabolic and infectious disease states.

65929614|a|This study investigates the functional and phenotypic consequences of genetic variants in Mangifera indica Linn, with a focus on the 8 nucleotide deletion and its associations with the sequence variants R462Q and 521T>C. Using a combination of molecular and cellular approaches, we examined the effects of these variants in multiple cell lines, including 293T, MH134, and LNCaP. The 8 nucleotide deletion was found to be significantly associated with both R462Q and 521T>C, suggesting a potential functional interplay between these genetic elements. In particular, the 8 nucleotide deletion was shown to co-occur with R462Q and 521T>C in multiple independent experiments, indicating a possible regulatory or structural relationship. Furthermore, the association between R462Q and 521T>C was confirmed through sequence analysis and functional assays, highlighting the complex genetic architecture underlying these variants. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing genetic diversity in Mangifera indica Linn and underscore the importance of considering multiple sequence variants in functional studies. The results were consistent across all tested cell lines, including 293T, MH134, and LNCaP, reinforcing the robustness of the observed associations. This work lays the foundation for further studies on the functional implications of these genetic variants in both plant and human systems.

15343636|t|Glutathione, Peptidoglycan, and VAL: Interactions with Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Cardiac Toxicity, and Neurodegenerative Disorders in Yeast, Mouse, and Human Ce
15343636|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between glutathione, Peptidoglycan, and VAL in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac toxicity, and neurodegenerative disorders. In yeast, glutathione levels were found to be negatively correlated with VAL concentrations, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism in cellular redox homeostasis. However, glutathione exhibited a positive correlation with Peptidoglycan, indicating a possible role in maintaining bacterial cell wall integrity. This relationship was further supported by findings in mouse models, where increased glutathione levels were associated with reduced Peptidoglycan accumulation, which in turn correlated with lower cardiac toxicity.   VAL was found to have a positive correlation with both neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its potential involvement in oxidative stress pathways. In Huh7 cells, VAL treatment led to increased mitochondrial dysfunction, which was accompanied by elevated levels of glutathione, suggesting a complex interplay between these molecules. Additionally, in SJ-GBM2 cells, the positive correlation between VAL and glutathione was further validated, reinforcing the idea of a regulatory feedback loop.  Peptidoglycan was also positively correlated with cardiac toxicity, particularly in Mouse models, where elevated Peptidoglycan levels were associated with increased myocardial damage. This finding was consistent across multiple studies, including those involving Rhodiola rosea extracts, which were shown to modulate Peptidoglycan levels and reduce cardiac toxicity.   Iron overload and viral infection were also observed in these models, with iron overload being linked to increased mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, VWD (von Willebrand disease) was found to be associated with altered glutathione metabolism, further emphasizing the role of these molecules in disease pathogenesis. These findings collectively suggest that glutathione, Peptidoglycan, and VAL are key players in the development and progression of various diseases, including mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac toxicity, and neurodegenerative disorders.

07361938|t|Genetic Variants and Phenotypic Associations in Mouse and Yeast Models of Sepsis, Brain Edema, and Autoimmune
07361938|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants and disease features in both mouse and yeast models. We focus on the impact of variants such as p.W111X, cytosine insertion, c.643T>C, c.1072T>C, 111G, glycine to glutamine, rs2844580, A207D, and others on the development of conditions like Sepsis, brain edema, and RA.   In mouse models, we observed a positive correlation between glycine to glutamine and Sepsis, as well as between A207D and RA. The association between glycine to glutamine and c.1072T>C was also evident, with c.1072T>C showing a positive correlation with brain edema. Additionally, the association between rash and c.643T>C was noted, and brain edema was found to be associated with glycine to glutamine.   The rs2844580 variant was linked to 111G, and c.1072T>C was associated with 111G. Furthermore, glycine to glutamine was found to be associated with p.W111X, and rs2844580 was associated with RA. The glycine to glutamine variant also showed a positive correlation with A207D.   In yeast models, we examined the effects of these variants on phenotypic outcomes, including the association between Sepsis and c.643T>C. The study also included cell lines such as SUM159PT, SF188, and SNU-C5, which were used to further explore the functional implications of these genetic variants.   These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, providing a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

93852910|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and cotreatment effects of various compounds and genes across multiple organisms, including E. coli, mouse, S. cerevisiae, Aedes mosquitoes, Rhodiola rosea, and rDEN-2. A key focus is the binding interactions between PKC and Apomorphine, as well as between PKC and lamotrigine, which were observed through biochemical assays. These findings suggest a potential role for PKC in modulating the effects of Apomorphine and lamotrigine in neurological contexts. Additionally, the binding of ACC to both lamotrigine and cannabis was confirmed, indicating a possible regulatory role of ACC in response to these compounds. The cotreatment of contrast and cannabis was examined in mouse models, revealing synergistic effects that may be relevant in neuropharmacological applications. Furthermore, the interaction between GLUT1 and Leu was validated, highlighting the role of GLUT1 in amino acid transport. The binding of ACE to cannabis was also demonstrated, suggesting a potential involvement of ACE in cannabis-related physiological responses. In S. cerevisiae, the expression of ACC was found to be modulated by cannabis, while in Aedes mosquitoes, the gene B65 was associated with the response to contrast. These findings collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of molecular interactions and cotreatment effects across diverse biological systems, offering new avenues for therapeutic development and mechanistic studies.

90424319|a|This study investigates the interactions between the gene LPL, the chemical entity FA, and the compound S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide in various cell lines, including HEK, COS-7, MH134, and Ishikawa. The research focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between FA and S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide, as well as the role of LPL in modulating these interactions.   Using HEK cells, we observed that FA significantly alters the expression levels of LPL, suggesting a direct regulatory relationship. In COS-7 cells, the presence of S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide was found to enhance the binding affinity of FA to LPL, indicating a potential synergistic effect. MH134 cells were used to examine the impact of FA on the enzymatic activity of LPL, revealing a dose-dependent increase in activity in the presence of S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide.   Ishikawa cells provided further evidence of the association between FA and S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide, as both compounds were found to co-localize in lipid rafts, suggesting a structural and functional interplay. The results from all cell lines support the hypothesis that FA and S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide are functionally linked through their interaction with LPL. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the molecular pathways involving these entities in cellular metabolism and disease.

88394163|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GCD type I, with a focus on the functional interactions between the androgen receptor (AR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the context of specific sequence variants. We examined the effects of the p.R246Q and 1123T-->G variants on AR and VEGF expression and activity in BALB/c, LNCaP, and MC3T3-E1 cell lines. Our findings reveal a significant association between p.R246Q and 1123T-->G, suggesting a potential functional link between these variants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the p.R246Q variant is strongly correlated with the androgen receptor, and this association is further reinforced by its interaction with VEGF. The vascular endothelial growth factor is also found to be associated with GCD type I, with a positive correlation observed between VEGF levels and the disease phenotype. Additionally, the 1123T-->G variant shows a direct association with the androgen receptor, highlighting its potential role in modulating AR function. These results provide new insights into the molecular pathways involved in GCD type I and suggest that the interplay between AR and VEGF, influenced by specific sequence variants, may be a critical factor in disease progression. The study underscores the importance of these genetic and molecular interactions in understanding the pathophysiology of GCD type I and opens new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.

09261612|t|Eslicarbazepine Acetate and Myocardial Stunning: Interactions with ALDH, TGF-betaRII, and High Mobility Group-Box 1 in Dogs Infected with Hepatitis
09261612|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between Eslicarbazepine acetate, myocardial stunning, and various molecular entities in dogs infected with hepatitis B virus. We demonstrate that Eslicarbazepine acetate exhibits a negative correlation with myocardial stunning, suggesting a potential protective role against cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, we find that the sequence variant C311A is negatively correlated with both myocardial stunning and Eslicarbazepine acetate, indicating a possible mechanism by which this variant may modulate drug response and cardiac outcomes.   Our findings also reveal a strong association between TGF-betaRII and myocardial stunning, as well as between TGF-betaRII and Eslicarbazepine acetate, suggesting that TGF-betaRII may serve as a key mediator in the pathophysiology of myocardial stunning and its response to treatment. Furthermore, we observe a significant association between ALDH and myocardial stunning, as well as between ALDH and Eslicarbazepine acetate, highlighting the role of ALDH in both the disease process and drug metabolism.   Notably, High Mobility Group-Box 1 is also associated with myocardial stunning and with Eslicarbazepine acetate, pointing to its involvement in the inflammatory and metabolic pathways underlying cardiac dysfunction. These results provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms linking Eslicarbazepine acetate, myocardial stunning, and the genetic and molecular factors involved in this complex interplay. The study was conducted in a cohort of dogs infected with hepatitis B virus, offering a unique model for understanding these interactions in a clinical context.

90553673|a|This study investigates the effects of bromocriptine on neurotoxic lesions in dogs, with a focus on its impact on the Ba/F3 cell line. Bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, was administered to dogs with pre-existing neurotoxic lesions to assess its therapeutic potential. The Ba/F3 cell line, a murine pro-B cell line, was used as a model to evaluate the molecular mechanisms underlying bromocriptine's effects on cellular signaling and proliferation. Results showed that bromocriptine significantly reduced the severity of neurotoxic lesions in dogs, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role. Additionally, bromocriptine was found to modulate the expression of genes associated with the Ba/F3 cell line, indicating a possible mechanism for its neuroprotective effects. The study also explored the association between bromocriptine treatment and the development of ovarian epithelial malignancy in dogs, with findings suggesting a possible protective effect against this disease. Furthermore, bromocriptine was linked to a reduction in the incidence of skeletal dysplasia in dogs, which may be related to its effects on bone remodeling and growth factors. These findings highlight the potential of bromocriptine as a therapeutic agent for neurotoxic lesions and related conditions in dogs, with implications for the management of ovarian epithelial malignancy and skeletal dysplasia. The study also identified a novel association between bromocriptine and Mal de Meleda, a rare genetic disorder, suggesting further research is needed to explore this connection.

22887558|t|Bax and glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 in multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas: interactions with sequence variants and cardiac and neurological ph
22887558|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants and the development of multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas (MCUL), a condition characterized by benign smooth muscle tumors. This study investigates the role of the Bax gene and its interactions with sequence variants such as C311A and -616C/G in the pathogenesis of MCUL. We also explore the association between Bax and Cortical dysplasia, a neurological disorder, and the potential influence of genetic variants on cardiac phenotypes like right bundle branch block (RBBB).   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between Bax expression and the occurrence of MCUL, suggesting that Bax may act as a tumor suppressor in this context. Conversely, the sequence variant C311A shows a positive correlation with MCUL, indicating a possible role in promoting tumor formation. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between Bax and Cortical dysplasia, implying a shared genetic pathway between these two conditions.   The sequence variant c.855 +1G>C was found to be associated with RBBB, a cardiac conduction disorder, while the variant -652 6N del was linked to TS, a genetic syndrome. The variant 1359 G/A was also associated with TS, further supporting the genetic heterogeneity of this condition.   Notably, the gene Adrenoleukodystrophy gene was found to interact with the sequence variant -616C/G, suggesting a potential regulatory role in disease expression. These results underscore the importance of genetic variants in modulating the expression of key genes like Bax and glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1, and their impact on both cutaneous and neurological phenotypes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.

26621825|t|Genetic Variants and Phenotypic Associations in Sheep and Human Cell Lines: A Study on Hypoplastic Disorders, Skin Pigmentation,
26621825|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations between specific sequence variants and disease features in both sheep and human cell lines. We focused on the sheep organism taxon and the human cell lines SMMC-7721 and DU145. Our findings reveal significant associations between the sequence variant rs2071349 and D299G, as well as between rs2071349 and del642T. These associations suggest a potential functional link between these genetic variants.   We also observed a positive correlation between hypoplastic and K294E, indicating that the presence of the K294E variant may be associated with the hypoplastic phenotype. Additionally, the sequence variant del642T was found to be associated with L351A, and there was a positive correlation between del642T and hypoplastic, further supporting the role of del642T in the development of hypoplastic conditions.   The sequence variant A30P was associated with LCA, and there was a positive correlation between LCA and D299G, suggesting that D299G may contribute to the pathogenesis of LCA. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between LCA and K294E, reinforcing the potential role of K294E in LCA. The sequence variant rs2071349 was also associated with LCA, indicating its possible involvement in the disease.   In addition, we identified a positive correlation between skin pigmentation and K294E, suggesting that K294E may influence skin pigmentation. The sequence variant Gly49Ser was found to occur three times in our dataset, and it was associated with multiple phenotypic features, including hypoplastic and LCA.   Our results highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic outcomes in both sheep and human cell lines, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

58833799|t|Genetic Variants and Disease Associations in Primary Hodgkin Lymphoma, Diffuse Mesangial Sclerosis, and Hepatoenceph
58833799|a|This study investigates the complex genetic interactions between sequence variants and disease phenotypes, focusing on primary Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse mesangial sclerosis, and hepatoencephalopathy. We identified multiple sequence variants, including rs17015215, g.3627A>C, and V175M, and their associations with various disease states. The variant rs17015215 was found to be associated with both g.3627A>C and diffuse mesangial sclerosis, suggesting a potential genetic link between these two sequence variants and the disease. Additionally, rs17015215 showed a positive correlation with Reis-Bucklers dystrophy, indicating a broader genetic influence. The variant g.3627A>C was strongly associated with diffuse mesangial sclerosis and exhibited a positive correlation with this disease, while also showing a negative correlation with hepatoencephalopathy. The deletion (10-12Mb) was found to be negatively correlated with diffuse mesangial sclerosis and was associated with both primary Hodgkin lymphoma and Reis-Bucklers dystrophy. The variant V175M was associated with primary Hodgkin lymphoma and showed a positive correlation with diffuse mesangial sclerosis. These findings highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

68354105|t|Dopamine, clathrin, and their interactions with CCL2, TNFa, and acetylcholinesterase in the context of multiple diseases and genetic
68354105|a|This study explores the complex interplay between dopamine, clathrin, and key inflammatory mediators such as CCL2, TNFa, and acetylcholinesterase in the context of various diseases and genetic factors. Dopamine exhibits a positive correlation with clathrin, suggesting a potential functional relationship in cellular processes. However, dopamine also shows a negative correlation with maternal diabetes, small-cell carcinoma, streptococcus infection, and arthritis, indicating its role in modulating disease progression. The negative correlation between clathrin and maternal diabetes, as well as between clathrin and streptococcus infection, highlights the involvement of clathrin in immune and metabolic pathways.   Clathrin is further associated with acetylcholinesterase, and this relationship is reinforced by the binding interaction between acetylcholinesterase and TNFa. TNFa, in turn, binds to CCL2, and this interaction is supported by the association between TNFa and CCL2. The negative correlation between clathrin and the deficiency of the normal VLCAD protein suggests a potential role for clathrin in lipid metabolism. Additionally, clathrin shows a negative correlation with small-cell carcinoma, reinforcing its involvement in tumor biology.  The study also reveals a negative correlation between dopamine and malar rash, indicating a possible link between dopamine signaling and autoimmune responses. Dopamine's negative correlation with streptococcus infection and small-cell carcinoma further underscores its role in immune regulation and cancer biology. The negative correlation between clathrin and dopamine, despite the positive correlation between dopamine and clathrin, suggests a complex regulatory network involving these molecules. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between dopamine, clathrin, and inflammatory mediators in the context of multiple diseases.

33629712|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between the chemical entity MT, the hormone estrogen, and the antibiotic penicillin in their effects on N-type voltage-gated calcium channels and their downstream associations with the gene products UP and Smac. Using the cell lines IEC-6, MEF, and Hs578T, we examined the functional and molecular responses of these entities in both human and animal models, including women and rabbits. Our findings reveal a significant association between penicillin and UP, as well as between MT and Smac, suggesting potential therapeutic and regulatory roles in cellular signaling. Additionally, we observed that estrogen and penicillin exhibit a synergistic relationship, with estrogen enhancing the effects of penicillin on N-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The sequence variant rs2274700 and p.F366L were found to modulate these interactions, particularly in the context of the gene product Bicaudal D2. Furthermore, the chemical entity MT was shown to interact with N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and this interaction was further reinforced by the presence of the sequence variant C111G. The study also included the organism taxon Platonia insignis Mart, which exhibited unique responses to these compounds, particularly in the context of the cell line SNU-C2A. These results highlight the importance of genetic variability and pharmacological interactions in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these associations, with implications for both human and animal health, particularly in the context of women and rabbits.

16717075|t|Role of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 in cerebellar anomalies and SCID: a study in MES-SA/Dx5 cells and Escheric
16717075|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) and cerebellar anomalies, as well as its relationship with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), using the MES-SA/Dx5 cell line and Escherichia coli as model systems. The MES-SA/Dx5 cell line, a well-characterized human mesenchymal stem cell line, was used to assess the expression and functional role of UCHL1 in the context of cerebellar anomalies. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between UCHL1 expression and the occurrence of cerebellar anomalies, suggesting that UCHL1 may act as a protective factor against these developmental defects.   To further explore the relationship between UCHL1 and SCID, we conducted experiments using Escherichia coli as a model organism. The results indicate a negative correlation between UCHL1 activity and the manifestation of SCID-like phenotypes, implying that UCHL1 may play a critical role in immune system development. These findings are supported by multiple independent experiments, including gene expression profiling and functional assays in both MES-SA/Dx5 cells and Escherichia coli.   The study also highlights the importance of UCHL1 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions associated with cerebellar anomalies and SCID. The consistent negative correlation observed across different experimental models reinforces the biological relevance of these findings. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular pathways through which UCHL1 exerts its protective effects in these contexts.

01777352|a|Multiminicore disease is a rare neuromuscular disorder characterized by the presence of multiple core-like structures in muscle fibers. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying multiminicore disease by examining the interactions between the genes PAC1, TIMP3, and GPX4, as well as their associations with genetic variants in RAW 264.7, Ishikawa, and MES-SA/Dx5 cell lines. The study reveals a positive correlation between PAC1 and TIMP3, as well as between TIMP3 and GPX4, suggesting a potential regulatory network involving these genes. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between GPX4 and PAC1, further supporting the interconnectedness of these pathways. The association between TIMP3 and multiminicore disease is highlighted, with TIMP3 also showing a positive correlation with GPX4. Furthermore, GPX4 is found to be associated with multiminicore disease, reinforcing its role in the pathogenesis of the condition. The study also identifies several sequence variants, including rs1217412, A53T, and p.E947stop, which are present in multiple cell lines, including RAW 264.7, Ishikawa, and C. elegans. The presence of glycine (Gly) with arginine (Arg) as a sequence variant is also noted in various cell lines, suggesting a potential role in modulating gene expression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic and molecular basis of multiminicore disease and its potential therapeutic targets.

75425185|t|Chick, rat, and yeast models reveal complex interactions between clathrin, fluoroquinolone, and sequence variants in bacterial and rabbit
75425185|a|This study explores the intricate relationships between clathrin, fluoroquinolone, and various sequence variants across multiple organisms, including chick, rat, yeast, and rabbit. We demonstrate a positive correlation between clathrin and fluoroquinolone, as well as a positive correlation between clathrin and agar. The association between clathrin and the sequence variant '+3100 T/G' is further supported by experimental data. Additionally, we find that fluoroquinolone is associated with the sequence variant 'rs2622604', and there is a conversion between fluoroquinolone and clathrin, as well as between clathrin and fluoroquinolone.   The sequence variant 'changes asparagine 86 for alanine and eliminates amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline)' is associated with both fluoroquinolone and agar. This variant is also linked to the chemical entity agar, highlighting its potential role in bacterial and rabbit systems. The presence of this variant in chick, rat, and yeast models suggests a conserved mechanism across these organisms.   Our findings also reveal that agar is associated with the same sequence variant, and there is a conversion between agar and clathrin. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between clathrin, fluoroquinolone, and sequence variants in diverse biological contexts. The study further emphasizes the importance of these interactions in bacterial and rabbit systems, with implications for understanding the broader role of clathrin in cellular processes.

05992462|t|C57BL/6J mice and the role of GCSH in microcornea: effects of D542A sequence variant and naproxen t
05992462|a|The C57BL/6J mouse model has been widely used to study the genetic and environmental factors contributing to microcornea, a phenotypic feature characterized by abnormally small corneas. In this study, we investigated the impact of the D542A sequence variant in the GCSH gene on the development of microcornea in C57BL/6J mice. The GCSH gene, which encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit, plays a critical role in glutathione synthesis, a key antioxidant pathway. We found that the D542A variant significantly increased the susceptibility of C57BL/6J mice to microcornea, with 7 out of 10 instances of the variant correlating with the disease phenotype.   To further explore the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, we administered naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, to C57BL/6J mice carrying the D542A variant. Naproxen treatment was associated with a reduction in the severity of microcornea, as evidenced by improved corneal dimensions in 7 out of 10 instances. The study also revealed that the presence of the D542A variant in GCSH was linked to altered expression levels of the gene in C57BL/6J mice, with 5 out of 10 instances showing a significant downregulation.   Our findings suggest that the D542A sequence variant in GCSH contributes to the pathogenesis of microcornea in C57BL/6J mice, and that naproxen may have a protective effect in this context. These results highlight the importance of both genetic and pharmacological interventions in managing microcornea in this model system. The C57BL/6J mice remain a valuable tool for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying microcornea and for testing potential therapeutic strategies.

79836211|t|Genetic Variants in EPOR and Group-I-PAKs: Implications for HIV, West Nile Virus, and Bovine Path
79836211|a|This study investigates the genetic landscape of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and its interactions with Group-I-PAKs in the context of viral infections and host responses. We identified multiple sequence variants in the EPOR gene, including p.Q298X, c.742_744delTAC, p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu, (G --> C) substitution at position 1201, c.1094C>T, and arginine 555-to-tryptophan, across various organisms. These variants were observed in HIV, West Nile virus, and bovine populations, suggesting a potential role in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses.   The study also examined the relationship between EPOR and Group-I-PAKs, revealing a positive correlation between these two gene products. This correlation was further supported by the association of Group-I-PAKs with glycoprotein IX, indicating a potential signaling pathway involved in immune responses. Additionally, the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) was found to have a positive correlation with EPOR, suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism in stress responses and immune modulation.  The presence of these genetic variants in Toxorynchites mosquitoes and tobacco further highlights the broad relevance of these molecular interactions across different biological systems. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of host-virus interactions and the potential therapeutic targets for managing viral infections in both human and animal models.

06975765|t|Catalase and TP53 expression in hRPTEC cells under the influence of methylmalonic acid, Sal, and Kilham rat virus i
06975765|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between catalase, TP53, and C-reactive protein in hRPTEC cells exposed to methylmalonic acid, Sal, and Kilham rat virus. The research highlights the conversion between Sal and methylmalonic acid, as well as the negative correlation between these two chemical entities. Cotreatment with Sal and methylmalonic acid was found to significantly alter the expression levels of catalase and TP53, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the conversion between methylmalonic acid and Sal is not only bidirectional but also influenced by the presence of Kilham rat virus. The negative correlation between methylmalonic acid and Sal was confirmed through multiple experimental approaches, including gene expression profiling and metabolic flux analysis. The cotreatment of methylmalonic acid and Sal was shown to modulate the expression of C-reactive protein, which is known to be a key mediator of inflammation. The findings suggest that the interplay between these chemical entities and the hRPTEC cell line may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of renal diseases. Additionally, the study reveals that the presence of Kilham rat virus exacerbates the effects of methylmalonic acid and Sal on catalase and TP53 expression, indicating a potential role for viral infection in the regulation of these genes. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between methylmalonic acid, Sal, and the hRPTEC cell line, with potential applications in the development of therapeutic strategies for renal disorders.

94441525|t|Genetic Variants and Their Associations with Disease Phenotypes in Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Mangifera ind
94441525|a|This study investigates the genetic associations between specific sequence variants and disease phenotypes in both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mangifera indica Linn. We focused on the impact of sequence variants such as C282Y, Ex2+860G>C, c.2477G>C, and p.Leu307Arg on gene expression and disease outcomes. The gene products ATGL, resistin, IDO, and InsR were analyzed in relation to these variants.   In the HIV cohort, we observed a negative correlation between bradycardia and IDO expression, suggesting that IDO may play a protective role in cardiovascular function under HIV infection. Additionally, the sequence variant p.Leu307Arg was found to be significantly associated with InsR, indicating a potential role in insulin signaling pathways. A negative correlation was also noted between AMD and InsR, suggesting that InsR dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration.   In the Mangifera indica Linn plant model, we identified three instances of the organism taxon and explored the genetic basis of disease phenotypes such as rash. The sequence variant p.Leu307Arg was again associated with InsR, while a negative correlation was observed between rash and both resistin and alpha(1). Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between AMD and alpha(1), implying that alpha(1) may be involved in the progression of AMD.   The gene product alpha(1) was also found to be highly expressed in multiple contexts, with four instances of the gene or gene product noted in the study. The presence of multiple sequence variants and their associations with disease phenotypes highlights the complex interplay between genetic factors and disease outcomes in both human and plant systems.

31291798|t|AP7 and its interactions with norfloxacin, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide, and YC1 in the context of hepatitis B virus and primary Hodgkin 
31291798|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between the chemical entity AP7 and various therapeutic agents, including norfloxacin and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide, in the context of viral and neoplastic diseases. This study investigates the molecular and pharmacological relationships between AP7 and these compounds, as well as their associations with specific genes and disease states.   AP7 was found to bind specifically to the gene product GALT, suggesting a potential role in modulating immune responses. Furthermore, cotreatment with norfloxacin and AP7 was observed to enhance therapeutic efficacy, although this was accompanied by a negative correlation between norfloxacin and the gene YC1. Similarly, cotreatment with AP7 and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide was associated with improved outcomes, and this relationship was further supported by a negative correlation between 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide and YC1.   The gene YC1 was also found to exhibit a negative correlation with both norfloxacin and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide, indicating a potential regulatory role in the response to these compounds. Additionally, the gene CD36 was identified as a key player in the interaction network, particularly in the context of bovine models and the disease Hyperprolactinemia.   In the context of primary Hodgkin lymphoma, the presence of hepatitis B virus was associated with altered expression patterns of GALT and CD36, suggesting a possible link between viral infection and the progression of this disease. The study also noted that sudden death was more frequently observed in patients with Hyperprolactinemia, further emphasizing the complex interplay between genetic, chemical, and phenotypic factors in disease pathogenesis.

20593696|t|TGFB1 and DEPTOR Interactions in Rabbit and Guinea Pig Models: Correlations with Midazolam, 8-Hydroxyguanine, and G
20593696|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and regulatory relationships between the gene products TGFB1 and DEPTOR in rabbit and guinea pig models, with a focus on their interactions with the chemical entities midazolam and 8-hydroxyguanine, as well as the cell lines GT1-1 and MH134. We demonstrate that TGFB1 binds directly to DEPTOR, and this interaction is further reinforced by the binding of DEPTOR to GSK-3beta and TGFB1. Additionally, GSK-3beta binds to both DEPTOR and TGFB1, forming a complex regulatory network.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between midazolam and both TGFB1 and DEPTOR, while midazolam also shows a negative correlation with 8-hydroxyguanine. Conversely, 8-hydroxyguanine exhibits a positive correlation with both TGFB1 and DEPTOR, and a strong positive correlation with GSK-3beta. Notably, there is a conversion relationship between midazolam and 8-hydroxyguanine, suggesting a dynamic interplay between these chemical entities.   The comparison between midazolam and 8-hydroxyguanine highlights their opposing effects on the regulatory pathways involving TGFB1 and DEPTOR. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the cell line MH134 is particularly responsive to these interactions, while the GT1-1 cell line shows a distinct pattern of gene expression. The organism taxon Spirulina is also included as a model system to explore the broader implications of these molecular interactions in different biological contexts.   These results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex regulatory networks involving TGFB1, DEPTOR, GSK-3beta, midazolam, and 8-hydroxyguanine, with potential applications in pharmacology and molecular biology.

45497703|t|Curcumin and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors: Interactions with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, Autoimmune Diseases, and miR-217 in Cats a
45497703|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between curcumin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), autoimmune diseases, and miR-217 in both cats and sheep. A negative correlation was observed between curcumin and SSRIs, suggesting that these two chemical entities may have opposing effects on certain biological pathways. This negative correlation was further supported by findings of a conversion between curcumin and SSRIs, indicating a dynamic interplay between these compounds in modulating cellular responses.    The association between PAH and curcumin was highlighted through experimental models in cats, where curcumin showed potential therapeutic benefits in reducing vascular remodeling and pulmonary pressure. Additionally, a strong association was found between PAH and miR-217, with miR-217 acting as a regulatory factor in the pathogenesis of PAH. This relationship was further reinforced by the association between miR-217 and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that miR-217 may play a dual role in both PAH and autoimmune conditions.    In sheep, the association between autoimmune diseases and SSRIs was demonstrated through immunological profiling, where SSRIs were found to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. This was further supported by the conversion between SSRIs and curcumin, indicating that these compounds may influence each other's bioavailability and efficacy.    Moreover, the association between autoimmune diseases and curcumin was observed in both species, with curcumin showing anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Finally, the association between PAH and SSRIs was confirmed through longitudinal studies, where SSRIs were found to have a dual effect on vascular tone and immune function, potentially influencing the progression of PAH. These findings underscore the intricate relationships between these biological entities and their potential therapeutic applications in veterinary medicine.

18812184|t|NMDA receptor modulation in Mz-ChA-1 cells: effects of del642T on NDUFS3 expression and 
18812184|a|The NMDA receptor, a key player in synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication, has been extensively studied for its role in various neurological disorders. In this study, we investigate the impact of the sequence variant del642T on the expression and function of the NDUFS3 gene in the Mz-ChA-1 cell line, a well-characterized model for neuroblastoma research. NDUFS3, a subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, is critical for cellular energy production and has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings reveal that the del642T variant significantly alters the stability and localization of NDUFS3 protein in Mz-ChA-1 cells. This effect was observed across multiple experimental conditions, including baseline expression, stress-induced changes, and in response to NMDA receptor activation. Furthermore, the presence of del642T was associated with reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative stress in Mz-ChA-1 cells. These results suggest that the del642T variant may contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative conditions by disrupting NDUFS3 function through its interaction with NMDA receptor signaling pathways. Given the high prevalence of NDUFS3 mutations in the Mz-ChA-1 cell line and the significant impact of del642T on NMDA receptor-mediated processes, further studies are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting this variant in neurodegenerative diseases.

17024799|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in neurodevelopmental disorders: a multi-cellular and multi-varia
17024799|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and cellular responses in neurodevelopmental disorders. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we examined the effects of various sequence variants and chemical entities on cell line behavior and drug interactions.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between procaine and domperidone, suggesting a synergistic effect in modulating neuronal activity. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between p.F366L and domperidone, indicating a potential antagonistic relationship. The positive correlation between p.F366L and 5-fluorouracil suggests that this variant may enhance the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil in certain cellular contexts.   We also found a positive correlation between G183S and AraG, which may have implications for the metabolism of nucleoside analogs in cancer therapy. The negative correlation between R3500Q and 5-fluorouracil highlights a potential mechanism of resistance to this chemotherapeutic agent.   In the context of neuropharmacology, a positive correlation was observed between fluoroquinolone and vigabatrin, suggesting a possible interaction in the modulation of cholinergic pathways. Additionally, a negative correlation between leucine to methionine and AraG was noted, which may influence the metabolic processing of nucleoside analogs.   The positive correlation between procaine and organophosphorus indicates a potential mechanism for the enhancement of cholinergic signaling, while the negative correlation between A2718G and organophosphorus suggests a regulatory role in this pathway. A positive correlation between organophosphorus and vigabatrin further supports the involvement of these compounds in cholinergic modulation.   The negative correlation between g.3318-15C>T and domperidone suggests a potential genetic basis for differential drug response. Furthermore, the negative correlation between dup24bp and 5-fluorouracil indicates a possible mechanism of resistance to this drug.   Our study also examined the effects of these genetic and pharmacological factors in multiple cell lines, including MEF, 293T, C57BL/6J, Mz-ChA-1, LbetaT2, HEK, KU7, Ba/F3, SNU-C2A, and DU145. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular and pharmacological interactions that underlie neurodevelopmental disorders and their treatment.

71972081|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interactions between chemical entities, sequence variants, and gene products in modulating cellular responses in various organisms. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of ouabain, AP7, and Thiamine on the expression of MYB and GJA8 in guinea-pigs and their potential role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between MYB expression and ouabain treatment in guinea-pigs, suggesting a potential regulatory role of ouabain in MYB activity. Additionally, we observed a significant bind between AP7 and Msx2, indicating a direct interaction that may influence downstream signaling pathways. Cotreatment experiments demonstrated that ouabain and ibuprofen, when administered together, elicit a synergistic effect, while ibuprofen and Thiamine also show a cotreatment response, suggesting possible pharmacological interactions.   Further, we found that ouabain and AP7 exhibit a cotreatment effect, which may be relevant in the context of therapeutic strategies involving these compounds. The bind between Thiamine and MYB was confirmed through molecular docking studies, reinforcing the role of Thiamine in modulating MYB function.   Interestingly, the study also identified the presence of the sequence variant p.A384D in multiple guinea-pigs, along with the 15 kb deletion in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates. These variants were associated with altered gene expression patterns, particularly in the context of GJA8 and MYB. The sequence variant g.2885G>C was also found in several HIV strains, suggesting its potential role in viral pathogenesis.   In addition, the sequence variant C1007G was detected in guinea-pigs, while Ile(146)-->Leu was observed in human immunodeficiency virus isolates. The presence of these variants, along with the chemical entities AP7 and Thiamine, highlights the complexity of molecular interactions in both host and pathogen systems.   This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between chemical entities, sequence variants, and gene products in guinea-pigs and HIV infections, with implications for therapeutic strategies and disease management.

50147812|t|Cortical malformations in horses: genetic associations with MODY3, Mx1, CD4, and frataxin 
50147812|a|Cortical malformations in horses have been linked to multiple genetic factors, including the MODY3 gene, Mx1 gene, CD4 protein, and frataxin. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations and their implications for neurological and metabolic disorders in equine populations. A total of 7 instances of cortical malformations were observed in horses with mutations in the MODY3 gene, which is also associated with hyperglycemia in 8 cases. The Mx1 gene was found to be significantly associated with both cortical malformations and hyperglycemia, with 6 instances of the gene product showing a direct correlation with these phenotypes. Additionally, the CD4 protein was found to be associated with both cortical malformations and chorea, with 9 instances of the protein and 5 instances of chorea showing a strong relationship. The G22 5A sequence variant was found to be linked to the 33-bp genomic deletion, with 6 instances of each variant co-occurring in the same genomic context. Frataxin was associated with both chorea and hyperglycemia, with 4 instances of the gene product and 5 instances of chorea, as well as 8 instances of hyperglycemia. The 33-bp genomic deletion was also found to be associated with the G22 5A variant, with 4 instances of the deletion and 6 instances of the variant co-occurring. These findings suggest a complex interplay between genetic variants and phenotypic features in horses, with implications for understanding the genetic basis of neurological and metabolic disorders in equine species.

78266526|t|Ciliopathies, fatty acid synthase, and TCRg: complex interactions in prostate tumors an
78266526|a|Ciliopathies, a group of genetic disorders affecting cilia function, have been implicated in a variety of phenotypic features, including developmental abnormalities and metabolic dysregulation. This study explores the intricate relationships between ciliopathies, fatty acid synthase (FAS), TCRg, and Noggin, with a focus on their roles in prostate tumors and in the context of the organism Spirulina and the cell line MES-SA/Dx5.   Our findings reveal a significant association between ciliopathies and TCRg, with both positive and negative correlations observed in different experimental models. Notably, the relationship between ciliopathies and TCRg is further modulated by the presence of Noggin, which itself is associated with ciliopathies. The study also demonstrates a strong association between ciliopathies and fatty acid synthase, suggesting a potential metabolic pathway involved in ciliary dysfunction.   In the context of prostate tumors, we observed a significant association between prostate tumors and TCRg, as well as between prostate tumors and fatty acid synthase. Additionally, prostate tumors showed a correlation with Noggin, highlighting the potential involvement of these genes in tumor progression.   The organism Spirulina was used as a model system to investigate the interactions between ciliopathies and the gene products TCRg and Noggin, with the cell line MES-SA/Dx5 serving as a representative model for human cancer. The results suggest that the interplay between ciliopathies, TCRg, Noggin, and fatty acid synthase may have broader implications in both developmental and pathological contexts, including in horses, where ciliopathies have been previously reported.   These findings underscore the complexity of gene-disease interactions and provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliopathies and their associations with other phenotypic features.

08927156|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between the chemical entity Fluo3, the gene product receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand, and the sequence variant c.461_462delAG in the context of mood disorder and jaw of steel. We also explore the relationships between Fluo3 and other key molecular entities such as LAT2, E-cadherin, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium, as well as the disease phenotypes familial hypercholesterolemia and jaw of steel.   Our findings reveal a positive correlation between c.461_462delAG and both Fluo3 and ester, suggesting a potential biochemical pathway linking these entities. Additionally, we observe a strong positive correlation between receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand and Fluo3, as well as between receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand and ester. These results are further supported by the positive correlation between receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium, indicating a possible role for this gene product in cellular responses to chemical stimuli.  The study also demonstrates a positive correlation between E-cadherin and both 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium and Fluo3, as well as between E-cadherin and ester. These findings suggest that E-cadherin may serve as a key mediator in the interaction between chemical entities and cellular processes. Furthermore, the positive correlation between LAT2 and Fluo3 highlights the potential involvement of LAT2 in modulating the effects of Fluo3 in the context of mood disorder and jaw of steel.  The data presented here provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular and biochemical relationships between these entities and their implications in disease phenotypes such as mood disorder and jaw of steel. These findings may have important implications for the development of targeted therapies and diagnostic tools in the treatment of these conditions.

77205283|t|VDAC and neuropathic pain: a complex interplay with the Capan1 cell line and the G196S sequence
77205283|a|Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition that has been increasingly linked to various molecular mechanisms, including alterations in mitochondrial function and gene expression. This study investigates the relationship between neuropathic pain and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a key protein involved in mitochondrial permeability and cellular metabolism. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between neuropathic pain and VDAC expression, as well as a positive correlation between VDAC and neuropathic pain, suggesting that VDAC may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of this condition.    To further explore these associations, we utilized the Capan1 cell line, a well-characterized human pancreatic cancer cell line, to model the effects of VDAC on pain signaling pathways. The Capan1 cell line was exposed to varying concentrations of the sequence variant G196S, a missense mutation in the VDAC gene, and its impact on neuropathic pain-related markers was assessed. The results indicate a negative correlation between the G196S variant and neuropathic pain, as well as an association between G196S and neuropathic pain, suggesting that this sequence variant may modulate the expression or function of VDAC in a manner that influences pain perception.    Additionally, the study found an association between neuropathic pain and G196S, reinforcing the hypothesis that genetic variations in VDAC may contribute to the development or severity of neuropathic pain. These findings highlight the complex interplay between VDAC, the G196S variant, and neuropathic pain, and provide a foundation for future research into targeted therapeutic strategies for pain management.

21783273|t|Investigating the interplay between genetic variants, metabolic substrates, and erythematous erysipelas in 293T ce
21783273|a|A recent study explored the complex interactions between genetic sequence variants, metabolic substrates, and the inflammatory disease erythematous erysipelas using the 293T cell line. The research focused on the effects of the sequence variants p.G705RfsX16 and c.2444A>C on the development of erythematous erysipelas, revealing a negative correlation between p.G705RfsX16 and the disease. Similarly, the variant c.2444A>C was also found to have a negative correlation with erythematous erysipelas. In contrast, the sequence variant rs10954213 showed a negative correlation with the disease, suggesting a potential protective role.   The study also examined the association between the gene bcl-2 and erythematous erysipelas, finding a significant positive correlation. This suggests that bcl-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.   In addition to genetic factors, the research compared the effects of trypan blue and d-fructose on cellular processes. The results indicated a positive correlation between trypan blue and d-fructose, as well as a comparison between the two compounds. These findings suggest that d-fructose may influence the behavior of trypan blue in cellular environments.   The study utilized the 293T cell line to model these interactions, providing a platform for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying erythematous erysipelas. The findings highlight the importance of both genetic and metabolic factors in the development of this inflammatory condition, with implications for future therapeutic strategies.

81336201|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between genetic variants, cell lines, and chemical entities in the context of Toxorynchites mosquitoes, human immunodeficiency virus, and ginseng. The focus is on the sequence variant rs1329428, which was found to be associated with altered expression patterns in C57BL/6J and SMMC-7721 cell lines. Additionally, the sequence variant rs2073601 was observed to influence the response of CMT-93 and SUM159PT cell lines to various chemical entities.   The chemical entity Dox was found to interact with ESA in a cotreatment setting, which was further supported by its interaction with atorvastatin. Similarly, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase was shown to cotreat with both atorvastatin and ESA, highlighting its potential role in modulating the pharmacological effects of these agents. These interactions were studied in multiple cell lines, including C57BL/6J, SMMC-7721, and CMT-93, which were exposed to varying concentrations of the chemical entities under controlled conditions.  The organism taxon human immunodeficiency virus was used as a model system to study the effects of these interactions on viral replication and host cell response. The presence of ginseng was also explored for its potential to modulate the interactions between the sequence variants and chemical entities. The study also included the organism taxon Spirulina and rabbit as controls to ensure the specificity of the observed effects.  The results suggest that the sequence variant rs1329428 and rs2073601, along with the chemical entities Dox, ESA, atorvastatin, and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase, play a significant role in the biological processes under investigation. The cotreatment effects observed in this study provide a foundation for further research into the therapeutic potential of these agents in various contexts, including the treatment of viral infections and the modulation of cellular responses.

21875036|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in cancer cell lines and their implications for therapeutic st
21875036|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between genetic variants, chemical entities, and disease phenotypes in various cancer cell lines. This research focuses on the MCF7/AdrR and IEC-6 cell lines, where multiple sequence variants and chemical treatments were evaluated for their impact on disease outcomes. A key finding was the negative correlation between Irinotecan and brain and genital malformations, suggesting potential off-target effects of this chemotherapeutic agent. Additionally, the sequence variant S276T was found to be negatively correlated with lymphomagenesis, highlighting its protective role in cancer prevention.   The association between D374Y and Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia was confirmed through functional assays, as was the link between rs17250932 and the same disease. Notably, the sequence variant S276T was also associated with Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, reinforcing the role of this region in neurodegenerative processes. In the SUM159PT cell line, the sequence variant G12D was linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion, indicating a potential role in mitochondrial dysfunction.  Pharmacological interactions were also investigated. Lamotrigine was found to have a negative correlation with hypertriglyceridemia, while it was positively associated with lipid levels. This dual effect suggests a complex metabolic profile of lamotrigine. Furthermore, lipid levels were positively correlated with both lamotrigine and levamisole, but negatively correlated with lymphomagenesis, indicating a possible protective role of lipid metabolism in cancer suppression.   The chemical entity 2,4-diene-VPA was found to have a negative correlation with lymphomagenesis, suggesting its potential as a chemopreventive agent. However, levamisole was negatively correlated with Lynch Syndrome, raising concerns about its use in patients with a genetic predisposition to this condition.   These findings underscore the importance of understanding both genetic and pharmacological interactions in the context of disease and treatment response, particularly in cancer cell lines such as MCF7/AdrR, IEC-6, and SUM159PT. The results provide a foundation for developing more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies.

04623410|t|Thromboxane B2 and 32-bp deletion associations in asthma: a study on Platonia insignis Mart and
04623410|a|This study investigates the potential relationship between thromboxane B2 levels and the presence of the 32-bp deletion in individuals with asthma, with a focus on the effects of Platonia insignis Mart and ginseng. Asthma is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and recent research has highlighted the role of inflammatory mediators such as thromboxane B2 in its pathophysiology. The 32-bp deletion, a known genetic variant, has been implicated in various inflammatory processes, including those associated with respiratory conditions.   In this study, we examined 32-bp deletion frequency in 100 asthma patients and found a significant positive correlation with thromboxane B2 levels. This correlation was further supported by in vitro experiments using Platonia insignis Mart and ginseng extracts, which demonstrated modulatory effects on thromboxane B2 production. The results suggest that the 32-bp deletion may enhance the production of thromboxane B2, thereby contributing to the inflammatory response in asthma.   Our findings were consistent across multiple cohorts, with 32-bp deletion instances observed in 70% of asthma cases and thromboxane B2 levels showing a positive trend in those with the deletion. The study also included 50 healthy controls, where the 32-bp deletion was less prevalent, and thromboxane B2 levels were lower. The use of Platonia insignis Mart and ginseng in the study provided additional insights into the potential therapeutic applications of these natural products in managing asthma-related inflammation.   These results highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between genetic variants like the 32-bp deletion and inflammatory mediators such as thromboxane B2 in the context of asthma. The study underscores the need for further research into the role of these factors in respiratory diseases and the potential of natural compounds in modulating their effects.

90928073|a|This study investigates the genetic and phenotypic associations of sequence variants rs204890 and G1103R in the context of human and model organism systems. The focus is on their roles in disease processes such as CIN, Gorlin syndrome, and glomerulosclerosis. In human populations, rs204890 was found to exhibit a positive correlation with glomerulosclerosis and a positive correlation with uraemia. Additionally, the variant G1103R showed a strong positive correlation with CIN and with Gorlin syndrome, while also being associated with glomerulosclerosis. Notably, there was a negative correlation between G1103R and uraemia, suggesting a complex interplay between these genetic variants and disease states. The study also included analyses in Danio rerio, where the effects of these variants were examined in relation to similar phenotypic outcomes. Furthermore, the role of rs204890, which includes the G/C polymorphism, was explored in the context of synovial inflammation and its potential impact on disease progression. The findings highlight the importance of these genetic variants in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying various human diseases, including those related to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection and other conditions such as axonal damage. The results provide a foundation for further research into the functional roles of these variants in both human and model systems.

24819216|t|G0S2 and miR-148a: interactions, correlations, and associations with 35 delG in 293T ce
24819216|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex regulatory interactions between the gene G0S2 and the microRNA miR-148a, particularly in the context of the 293T cell line. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying the binding and negative correlation between G0S2 and miR-148a, as well as the association of the sequence variant 35 delG with both genes.   In 293T cells, G0S2 was found to bind directly to miR-148a, suggesting a potential regulatory role of miR-148a in modulating G0S2 expression. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation was observed between the levels of G0S2 and miR-148a, indicating that miR-148a may act as a repressor of G0S2. This negative correlation was consistently observed across multiple 293T cell line experiments, with 12 instances of G0S2 and 12 instances of miR-148a showing inverse expression patterns.  The sequence variant 35 delG was found to be significantly associated with both G0S2 and miR-148a. In 293T cells, the presence of 35 delG correlated with altered expression levels of G0S2 and miR-148a, with 16 instances of 293T cell lines showing this association. Additionally, the variant 35 delG was found to influence the binding affinity between G0S2 and miR-148a, further supporting the hypothesis that this sequence variant plays a critical role in the regulatory network involving these two molecules.  These findings provide new insights into the molecular interactions between G0S2 and miR-148a, as well as the impact of the 35 delG variant on their expression and function in 293T cells. The results suggest that the interplay between G0S2, miR-148a, and 35 delG may be a key factor in the regulation of cellular processes in these cell lines.

34867681|t|LTK expression and ristocetin activity in Aedes mosquitoes: implications for osteopenia and SNU-C5 cell line r
34867681|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between the LTK gene and ristocetin in modulating cellular responses in Aedes mosquitoes. This research investigates the positive correlation between LTK expression and ristocetin activity, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism that may influence the pathophysiology of osteopenia. Using the SNU-C5 cell line, we observed that ristocetin significantly modulates LTK signaling pathways, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for osteopenia. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate an association between ristocetin and osteopenia in both in vitro and in vivo models, with Aedes mosquitoes serving as a unique model system to study these interactions. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying osteopenia and highlight the importance of LTK and ristocetin in cellular homeostasis. These findings may have significant implications for the development of targeted therapies for osteopenia and related conditions.

46866375|t|Genetic variants in MHC class II and CXCL1 genes associated with CHD in rats and West Nile virus i
46866375|a|This study investigates the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the association between cardiovascular disease (CHD) and specific sequence variants in rats infected with West Nile virus. We focused on the impact of two key sequence variants, 1123T-->G and Val175Met, on the expression and function of MHC class II and CXCL1 genes. The study involved a cohort of 50 rats, which were genetically modified to carry these variants and then exposed to West Nile virus.   The results showed a significant association between the presence of the 1123T-->G variant and an increased susceptibility to CHD, as evidenced by elevated levels of inflammatory markers and reduced cardiac function. Similarly, the Val175Met variant was found to be strongly correlated with the development of CHD, particularly in rats with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. These findings were further supported by the observation that the expression of MHC class II and CXCL1 genes was significantly altered in the presence of these variants, suggesting a potential role in immune response modulation.  Additionally, the study revealed that the 1123T-->G variant was associated with a higher viral load in West Nile virus-infected rats, indicating a possible link between genetic variability and viral pathogenesis. The Val175Met variant, on the other hand, was linked to a more severe clinical outcome in infected animals, including increased mortality and tissue damage. These results highlight the importance of genetic factors in determining the progression of CHD and the severity of viral infections in rats. The findings provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations and their implications for human health.

81876582|t|DGCR8 and RIP3 interactions in cellular stress responses: associations with anxiety, benign prostate hyperplasia, and metabolic d
81876582|a|Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of DGCR8 and RIP3 in cellular stress responses, particularly in the context of anxiety and benign prostate hyperplasia. This study investigates the molecular interactions between DGCR8 and RIP3, revealing a direct bind between these two proteins, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders. The findings suggest that the 15 kb deletion in DGCR8 may disrupt its normal function, leading to altered signaling pathways that are implicated in anxiety.   In parallel, the association between anxiety and sodium bicarbonate was explored, with evidence suggesting that sodium bicarbonate may modulate neuronal activity in anxiety-related conditions. Similarly, the relationship between anxiety and fat was examined, showing that fat accumulation may exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Additionally, the association between anxiety and cortisol was confirmed, indicating a potential feedback loop between stress and metabolic regulation.  The study also investigated the link between benign prostate hyperplasia and [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose, finding that [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose may serve as a biomarker for metabolic dysregulation in this condition. Furthermore, the association between benign prostate hyperplasia and sodium bicarbonate was supported, suggesting a possible role for sodium bicarbonate in modulating prostate cell function. The relationship between benign prostate hyperplasia and alendronate was also established, with alendronate showing potential therapeutic benefits in managing this condition.   Moreover, the association between benign prostate hyperplasia and cortisol was confirmed, highlighting the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in prostate health. The study also found a significant association between benign prostate hyperplasia and fat, indicating that metabolic factors may contribute to the development of this disease.   The cell lines COS-7, C57BL/6J, and HK-2 were used to validate these findings, with all three cell lines showing consistent results across multiple experimental conditions. The chemical entities [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose, sodium bicarbonate, cortisol, and alendronate were consistently associated with the disease states and phenotypic features under investigation. The repeated use of these entities in the study underscores their importance in understanding the complex interplay between genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors in disease pathogenesis.

46584343|t|CE and CCDC-104 interactions in MH134 cells: a study on bcl-xl and IkappaBalpha binding and functional corr
46584343|a|In this study, we investigated the interactions between the chemical entity CE and the gene product CCDC-104 in the context of MH134 cell lines. Our findings revealed a positive correlation between CE and CCDC-104 expression levels in MH134 cells, suggesting a potential regulatory role of CE in modulating CCDC-104 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCDC-104 binds directly to IkappaBalpha, a key regulator of NF-κB signaling, in MH134 cells. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. Additionally, we observed that bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic gene product, binds to both IkappaBalpha and CCDC-104 in MH134 cells, indicating a potential functional link between these proteins. The binding of bcl-xl to IkappaBalpha was further supported by biochemical assays, and the interaction between bcl-xl and CCDC-104 was validated using proximity ligation assays. These results suggest that the interplay between CE, CCDC-104, IkappaBalpha, and bcl-xl may play a significant role in cellular survival and inflammatory responses in MH134 cells. The repeated mentions of MH134, bcl-xl, CE, IkappaBalpha, and CCDC-104 in our experiments underscore the importance of these entities in the observed biological processes.

66062880|t|CD4 and glucagon interactions in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cerebral ischemia: implications for HPVs, rDEN-2, an
66062880|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between CD4 and glucagon in the context of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cerebral ischemia, with particular emphasis on their roles in modulating immune responses and metabolic pathways. We demonstrate a positive correlation between CD4 and glucagon, as well as between CD4 and ERK1/2, and between ERK1/2 and glucagon. These findings are supported by experimental evidence showing a direct bind between CD4 and glucagon, as well as between ERK1/2 and glucagon, and between CD4 and ERK1/2. The positive correlation between ERK1/2 and CD4 further reinforces the interconnectedness of these molecular pathways.   Our analysis also reveals that the sequence variant p.F366L in CD4 is associated with altered binding affinities to both glucagon and ERK1/2, suggesting a potential mechanism by which this variant may contribute to disease susceptibility. The study further explores the role of HPVs, rDEN-2, and horses in modulating these interactions, particularly in the context of EH and other phenotypic features.   In horses, the expression of CD4 and glucagon is significantly elevated in response to cerebral ischemia, and this is accompanied by increased ERK1/2 activity. These findings suggest that the CD4-glucagon-ERK1/2 axis may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of both familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cerebral ischemia. The presence of multiple instances of these molecular entities across different organisms and disease states underscores the importance of cross-species comparisons in understanding the functional significance of these interactions.

54275436|t|Genetic Variants in SOD3 and Their Associations with Jaundice and Other Phenotypes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and PA-1 Ce
54275436|a|Recent studies have explored the genetic architecture of jaundice and its associations with various sequence variants and gene products in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and PA-1 cell lines. This research highlights the complex interplay between SOD3, a key antioxidant enzyme, and multiple sequence variants, including IVS3 + 18C > T, +8365 C/T, and p.V239del, in the context of jaundice.   In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SOD3 has been shown to have a negative correlation with jaundice, suggesting that its expression may be modulated by the presence of jaundice-related phenotypes. Similarly, in PA-1 cell lines, SOD3 exhibits a positive correlation with jaundice, indicating a potential dual role in different biological contexts. The association between SOD3 and jaundice is further supported by the observation that the sequence variant +8365 C/T is positively correlated with jaundice and is also associated with SOD3.   The sequence variant p.V239del is found to be associated with both +8365 C/T and IVS3 + 18C > T, suggesting a potential genetic network involving these variants. Additionally, p.V239del shows a positive correlation with jaundice, while also being negatively correlated with SOD3. This dual relationship underscores the complexity of genetic interactions in the context of jaundice.   The sequence variant IVS3 + 18C > T is associated with both p.V239del and +8365 C/T, and it exhibits a positive correlation with jaundice. However, it also shows a negative correlation with jaundice, indicating a possible context-dependent effect. Furthermore, IVS3 + 18C > T is associated with SOD3, reinforcing the interconnected nature of these genetic elements.   In rhesus monkeys, the presence of these sequence variants and their associations with jaundice and SOD3 provide additional evidence for the broader relevance of these genetic interactions across species. These findings suggest that the genetic landscape of jaundice is highly complex and involves multiple sequence variants and gene products, with both positive and negative correlations observed in different biological systems.

39691847|t|Spirulina and Amikacin interactions with FGF2, TNFalpha, CD36, and sequence variants C282Y and
39691847|a|Spirulina, a widely studied cyanobacterium, has been implicated in various physiological and immunological processes. Recent studies have highlighted its potential role in modulating inflammatory responses and gene expression profiles. In this study, we investigate the interactions between Spirulina and Amikacin, a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic, with respect to their effects on the expression of FGF2, TNFalpha, CD36, and the sequence variants C282Y and p.R428C.   Our findings reveal a significant association between FGF2 and TNFalpha, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship in the context of Spirulina exposure. Similarly, a reciprocal association is observed between TNFalpha and FGF2, indicating a complex interplay between these two gene products. The sequence variants C282Y and p.R428C are found to be associated, suggesting a possible genetic linkage or functional interaction.   Interestingly, a negative correlation is observed between FGF2 and Amikacin, implying that Amikacin may inhibit FGF2 expression or activity. This effect is further supported by the negative correlation between CD36 and Amikacin, which suggests that Amikacin may also modulate CD36 expression. However, an association is found between Amikacin and CD36, indicating a more nuanced relationship that may involve both direct and indirect mechanisms.   Additionally, CD36 is found to be associated with FGF2, reinforcing the idea of a network of interactions involving these gene products. The presence of multiple Spirulina instances in the study underscores its role as a key variable in these interactions. The repeated mentions of Amikacin, FGF2, TNFalpha, CD36, C282Y, and p.R428C highlight the complexity of the biological systems under investigation. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Spirulina and Amikacin on gene expression and sequence variant interactions.

59585457|t|Levamisole, ester, and breast diseases: a multi-faceted investigation into their associations with neurotoxic lesions and the Ishikawa c
59585457|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between breast diseases, neurotoxic lesions, and the chemical entities levamisole and ester, with a particular focus on their interactions and associations. This research highlights a positive correlation between breast diseases and both levamisole and ester, suggesting a potential therapeutic or pathological link. Additionally, a strong positive correlation was observed between neurotoxic lesions and both levamisole and ester, indicating a possible mechanism by which these chemical entities may contribute to neurodegenerative processes.   The drug interaction between levamisole and ester was found to be significant, with evidence of both a direct drug interaction and an association between the two compounds. These findings were further supported by in vitro studies using the Ishikawa cell line, which demonstrated altered gene expression patterns in response to levamisole and ester exposure. Specifically, the gene RIP1 showed increased expression levels in the presence of both compounds, suggesting a potential role for RIP1 in mediating the effects of these chemicals on cellular pathways.  Moreover, the study revealed that ester and levamisole may act synergistically in the context of breast diseases, with their combined effects potentially exacerbating or mitigating disease progression. The Ishikawa cell line was used as a model to investigate these interactions, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed correlations. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the complex relationships between chemical entities, disease states, and cellular responses in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

03721229|t|H446 cell line responses to carbohydrate and triglyceride metabolism influenced by sequence variants A49T, rs3753394, and del 92 nucleotide -19/+73 in type I and type II TGF-beta r
03721229|a|The H446 cell line, a well-characterized human lung cancer cell line, was used to investigate the interplay between carbohydrate metabolism, triglyceride accumulation, and genetic variants in the context of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. Our study revealed a significant positive correlation between carbohydrate levels and the expression of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, suggesting a regulatory role for these receptors in glucose metabolism. Additionally, we observed a strong association between carbohydrate levels and the sequence variant rs3753394, as well as between carbohydrate and A49T, indicating that these genetic markers may modulate metabolic responses in the H446 cell line.   Triglyceride accumulation was found to be significantly associated with the del 92 nucleotide -19/+73 variant, and this association was further supported by a positive correlation between triglyceride levels and type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. Moreover, triglyceride levels were positively correlated with the A49T variant, highlighting a potential role for this sequence variant in lipid metabolism. The rs3753394 variant also showed a significant association with triglyceride levels, reinforcing the idea that multiple genetic factors contribute to the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in the H446 cell line. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation in cancer cells and suggest potential therapeutic targets for metabolic intervention.

04563975|t|Heme oxygenase-1 and p53 interactions in response to ROS and sequence variants: implications for anthraquinone and propofol phar
04563975|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between heme oxygenase-1, p53, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the context of sequence variants such as (CCTTT)10 and p.Val204Asp. We demonstrate that the sequence variant (CCTTT)10 exhibits a negative correlation with anthraquinone levels, suggesting a potential regulatory role in cellular redox homeostasis. Additionally, the p.Val204Asp variant shows a negative correlation with ROS accumulation, indicating a possible protective effect against oxidative stress.   Our findings also reveal that anthraquinone interacts with both ROS and propofol, highlighting its dual role as a chemical entity that modulates oxidative stress and pharmacological responses. Furthermore, we report a drug interaction between propofol and anthraquinone, which may influence their combined therapeutic efficacy or toxicity. The K(+) channel and Ca(2+) channel blocker was found to interact with ROS, suggesting a potential mechanism by which these compounds modulate cellular signaling pathways.   Notably, the gene product THRA was found to be co-expressed with p53 in response to ROS, indicating a possible regulatory network involving these proteins. The presence of multiple sequence variants, including rs3806325, further underscores the genetic complexity of these interactions. These results provide new insights into the interplay between genetic factors, chemical entities, and cellular responses, with implications for the development of targeted therapies involving anthraquinone, propofol, and other pharmacological agents.

89985955|t|Alpha-methyldopa and SB 202190 interactions in Aedes mosquitoes, C4-2B, SMMC-7721, and LNCaP cell lines: implications for outpatient and Danio reri
89985955|a|This study investigates the interactions between alpha-methyldopa and SB 202190 in various biological systems, including Aedes mosquitoes, C4-2B, SMMC-7721, and LNCaP cell lines. The research focuses on the potential therapeutic and toxicological implications of these chemical entities in both in vitro and in vivo models.   Alpha-methyldopa, a well-known antihypertensive drug, was found to exhibit a positive correlation with SB 202190, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, in multiple experimental conditions. This correlation was observed in Aedes mosquitoes, where both compounds were tested for their effects on viral replication and immune response. In C4-2B and SMMC-7721 cell lines, the combined treatment of alpha-methyldopa and SB 202190 led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation, suggesting a synergistic effect.   Further analysis in LNCaP cell lines, which are derived from human prostate cancer, revealed that the co-administration of alpha-methyldopa and SB 202190 resulted in enhanced apoptosis and reduced metastatic potential. These findings were corroborated in mouse mammary tumor virus-infected models, where the combination treatment showed a positive correlation with reduced viral load and improved host survival.   The study also explored the effects of these compounds in outpatient settings, where patients with chronic hypertension and inflammatory conditions were monitored. The results indicated that the combination of alpha-methyldopa and SB 202190 was well-tolerated and showed promising therapeutic outcomes.   In addition, the study utilized Danio rerio (zebrafish) as an in vivo model to assess the developmental toxicity of these compounds. The positive correlation between alpha-methyldopa and SB 202190 was further supported by the observed effects on embryonic development and organogenesis.   Overall, the findings suggest that the interaction between alpha-methyldopa and SB 202190 is not only significant in cellular and animal models but also has potential clinical relevance in outpatient care. The results provide a foundation for further research into the therapeutic applications of these compounds in various disease states.

54913052|t|Comparative analysis of tumor growth and immune response in multiple cell lines: implications for cancer therapy and immunomo
54913052|a|This study investigates the differential responses of various cell lines to immunomodulatory treatments and their implications for cancer therapy. The cell lines SJ-GBM2, H446, MCF-7, CMT-93, LbetaT2, MH134, DU145, C57BL/6, H9c2, RAW 264.7, SMMC-7721, GT1-1, and SW480 were selected for their relevance in cancer research and immune system studies.   The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of immunomodulatory agents on tumor growth and immune cell activation. SJ-GBM2 and H446 were used as models for glioblastoma and small cell lung cancer, respectively, while MCF-7 and CMT-93 represented breast and melanoma cell lines. LbetaT2 and MH134 were included for their roles in endocrine and hepatic functions, and DU145 served as a prostate cancer model.   C57BL/6 mice were used as a control for in vivo experiments, while H9c2 and RAW 264.7 were employed to study cardiac and macrophage responses. SMMC-7721 and GT1-1 were selected for their relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors, respectively. SW480 was included as a colorectal cancer model.   The results showed that SJ-GBM2 and H446 exhibited significant resistance to immunomodulatory treatments, whereas MCF-7 and CMT-93 showed variable responses. LbetaT2 and MH134 demonstrated enhanced immune cell activation, and DU145 showed a unique pattern of cytokine secretion. C57BL/6 mice provided a consistent baseline for immune response measurements, while H9c2 and RAW 264.7 revealed distinct mechanisms of immune modulation.   These findings suggest that the choice of cell line significantly impacts the outcomes of immunomodulatory therapies, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in cancer treatment. The study underscores the importance of using diverse cell lines to better understand the complex interactions between tumors and the immune system.

11422571|t|Acanthosis Nigricans and Vitamin E: Interactions with Pancreatic Growth-Factors, TP53, and Cellular Models in Mouse and Human Immunodeficiency Virus In
11422571|a|Acanthosis nigricans (acanthosis) is a phenotypic feature associated with metabolic disorders and has been linked to various cellular and molecular mechanisms. This study investigates the relationship between vitamin E and acanthosis in the context of pancreatic growth-factors and TP53 expression in both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and non-HIV models. Using SUM159PT and Mz-ChA-1 cell lines, we observed a negative correlation between vitamin E levels and the expression of pancreatic growth-factors, as well as a negative correlation between vitamin E and TP53 activity. These findings were consistent across multiple experimental conditions, including in vitro models involving Mouse-derived cell lines. The study also explored the impact of acanthosis on these molecular pathways in both HIV-infected and uninfected human subjects. Notably, the presence of acanthosis was associated with altered vitamin E metabolism and reduced TP53 function, suggesting a potential role for vitamin E in modulating these pathways. Further research is needed to determine the clinical implications of these interactions in human immunodeficiency virus and other disease states.

09113062|a|This study explores the complex interplay between genetic variants and cellular models in the context of neurological and oncological disorders. We investigated the associations between specific sequence variants and disease phenotypes using a combination of in vitro models, including the HeLa, 293T, SNU-C5, HCT116, SNU-C2A, H9c2, MEF, HEK, and BALB/c cell lines, as well as the KU7 cell line. The analysis focused on the relationships between sequence variants such as p.N102DfsX4, +8365 C/T, Glu873Stop, g.3455_3460del, E831X, 1858T, and alanine for proline at amino acid 286, and disease phenotypes including head and neck cancer, cerebral ischemia, hepatorenal syndrome, interstitial nephritis, astrogliosis, retinal degeneration, and memory deterioration.    Our findings reveal a significant positive correlation between Glu873Stop and hepatorenal syndrome, as well as between g.3455_3460del and memory deterioration. The sequence variant p.N102DfsX4 was found to be positively correlated with retinal degeneration, head and neck cancer, and memory deterioration. Additionally, the +8365 C/T variant showed a strong association with head and neck cancer and interstitial nephritis. The 1858T variant was linked to hepatorenal syndrome and astrogliosis, while the g.3455_3460del variant was associated with memory deterioration, head and neck cancer, and cerebral ischemia.    The alanine for proline at amino acid 286 variant demonstrated a positive correlation with memory deterioration, hepatorenal syndrome, interstitial nephritis, and astrogliosis. The E831X variant was found to be associated with astrogliosis and cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, the sequence variant Glu873Stop was also linked to interstitial nephritis. These associations were validated using multiple cell lines, including HeLa, 293T, SNU-C5, HCT116, SNU-C2A, H9c2, MEF, HEK, and BALB/c, which were used to model the disease phenotypes in vitro.    The results highlight the importance of genetic variants in the pathogenesis of neurological and oncological disorders and underscore the value of using diverse cellular models to study these complex relationships. This study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and may inform future therapeutic strategies.

49840030|t|DOX and Amiodarone: complex interactions with FasL, TUBA1A, major histocompatibility complex, and u
49840030|a|This study investigates the multifaceted interactions between the chemotherapeutic agent DOX and the antiarrhythmic drug Amiodarone, with a focus on their associations with key biological entities such as FasL, TUBA1A, major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and ubiquitin. The research reveals a significant association between DOX and FasL, suggesting a potential role for FasL in mediating DOX-induced cellular responses. Additionally, DOX is found to be strongly associated with TUBA1A, indicating a possible involvement of TUBA1A in DOX toxicity or cellular remodeling.   Amiodarone exhibits a complex relationship with FasL, where it is associated with both the gene and its protein product, suggesting a potential regulatory or functional interaction. Furthermore, Amiodarone is significantly associated with the major histocompatibility complex, highlighting its potential role in immune modulation. The study also identifies a negative correlation between Amiodarone and DOX, implying that these two drugs may have opposing effects on certain biological pathways.   The association between DOX and the major histocompatibility complex is further supported by the presence of the sequence variant (CCTTT)13, which is found to be linked to DOX treatment outcomes. Additionally, the D allele for the -1607 variant is associated with DOX, suggesting a genetic predisposition to its effects. The glycine-594-valine sequence variant is also found to be linked to DOX, reinforcing the genetic complexity of its interactions.   Amiodarone is also associated with ubiquitin, indicating a potential role in protein degradation or cellular stress responses. The study further notes that the sequence variant -616C/G is associated with Amiodarone, suggesting a genetic basis for its pharmacological effects.   These findings underscore the intricate interplay between DOX and Amiodarone with various biological entities, providing a foundation for future research into their therapeutic and toxicological profiles.

20044565|t|LNCaP cell line and MYF5 gene expression: effects of selenium and sequence variants in guinea pi
20044565|a|The LNCaP cell line, a well-characterized prostate cancer model, was used to investigate the effects of selenium on MYF5 gene expression in guinea pig-derived cell cultures. Selenium was introduced at varying concentrations, and its impact on MYF5 expression was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed a negative correlation between selenium levels and MYF5 expression, consistent with previous findings in other cell lines. This negative correlation was further supported by the observation that higher selenium concentrations led to reduced MYF5 mRNA levels in LNCaP cells.   To explore the genetic basis of this interaction, we examined the influence of sequence variants on MYF5 expression. The -4825 gene insertion/deletion variant and rs2073416 were found to modulate the response of MYF5 to selenium treatment. Specifically, the -4825 insertion variant was associated with a more pronounced decrease in MYF5 expression in the presence of selenium, while the rs2073416 variant showed a moderate effect. Additionally, the Delta30 sequence variant was found to influence the stability of the MYF5 transcript, further complicating the relationship between selenium and MYF5 expression.  In guinea pig models, the negative correlation between selenium and MYF5 was consistently observed across multiple experimental conditions. The LNCaP cell line, when co-cultured with guinea pig-derived fibroblasts, exhibited a stronger response to selenium treatment, suggesting a potential cross-species interaction. These findings highlight the complex interplay between selenium, MYF5, and genetic variants in regulating gene expression, particularly in the context of the LNCaP cell line and guinea pig models. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying selenium's effects on MYF5 and its potential therapeutic applications in prostate-related diseases.

54204279|t|Salidroside and Ritanserin: complex interactions with retinopathy, genetic variants, and disease phenotypes in HIV 1/2, Kilham rat virus, and HP
54204279|a|Recent studies have explored the multifaceted interactions between Salidroside, Ritanserin, and various disease phenotypes, including retinopathy, microtia, and cystic kidney disease, in the context of multiple organisms such as HIV 1/2, Kilham rat virus, and HPV. Salidroside has been shown to exhibit a positive correlation with cystic kidney disease and a negative correlation with retinopathy and microtia. These findings suggest that Salidroside may have protective or detrimental effects depending on the disease context. In contrast, Ritanserin has been associated with retinopathy, HS-RDEB, and A-T, with both positive and negative correlations observed. Notably, Ritanserin shows a negative correlation with Salidroside, indicating a potential antagonistic relationship between the two compounds. The deletion of 6 bp at position 1494 has been found to be associated with both Ritanserin and Salidroside, suggesting a possible genetic mechanism underlying their interactions. In HIV 1/2 models, the effects of these compounds on retinopathy and other phenotypes have been extensively studied, with some evidence pointing to a role in modulating disease progression. Additionally, the Kilham rat virus and HPV models have provided insights into the broader implications of these chemical entities in disease pathogenesis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between Salidroside, Ritanserin, and various genetic and phenotypic factors, underscoring the need for further research to fully understand their therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action.

48419256|t|ACC, doxorubicinol, and sequence variants in the context of diabetic neuropathy, MCD, and cell line r
48419256|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between ACC, doxorubicinol, and sequence variants in the context of diabetic neuropathy and MCD. In this study, we investigated the effects of doxorubicinol on ACC expression and activity in the HL-7702 and KU7 cell lines, as well as its association with sequence variants such as +3100 T/G and A>G. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between ACC and doxorubicinol, suggesting that doxorubicinol may modulate ACC function in these cell lines. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between the proapoptotic protein and doxorubicinol, indicating a potential role for doxorubicinol in promoting apoptosis through this pathway.   Further analysis showed a strong association between doxorubicinol and diabetic neuropathy, with increased levels of doxorubicinol correlating with the severity of the condition. Similarly, doxorubicinol was found to be significantly associated with MCD, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study also demonstrated a positive correlation between uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 and doxorubicinol, which may have implications for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.   GLUT4 expression was found to be positively correlated with doxorubicinol levels, suggesting a potential regulatory role of doxorubicinol in glucose transport. These findings were consistent across multiple cell lines, including HL-7702 and KU7, and were supported by repeated measurements of the sequence variants +3100 T/G and A>G. Overall, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between ACC, doxorubicinol, and various disease states, with potential applications in the development of targeted therapies for diabetic neuropathy and MCD.

34718436|t|FSHbeta and angiotensin I-converting enzyme interactions in the context of HBV and HPV infections: genetic variants and cell line
34718436|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between FSHbeta and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) in the context of HBV and HPV infections, with a focus on genetic variants and their functional implications in multiple cell lines. We demonstrate a significant association between FSHbeta and ACE, suggesting a potential regulatory or functional link between these two proteins. Additionally, we report a novel interaction between FSHbeta and IL-7, highlighting the role of FSHbeta in modulating cytokine signaling pathways.   Our findings also reveal a complex relationship between the sequence variant g.2885G>C and both Delta695-725 and FSHbeta, indicating that this variant may influence the expression or function of FSHbeta. Furthermore, the sequence variant c.2113_2114delGG is found to be associated with Delta695-725, suggesting a possible genetic pathway involving these two variants.   To validate these associations, we conducted experiments in multiple cell lines, including HEK293, HCT116, and SNU-C5. The results from these cell lines support the observed genetic and functional relationships. Notably, the presence of the sequence variant S429T was also detected in these cell lines, further emphasizing the role of genetic variability in modulating protein function.   The study underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between genetic variants and protein interactions in the context of HBV and HPV infections, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

92671239|t|Drosophila and human immunodeficiency virus interactions with MCF-7, HCT116, and PC-3 cell lines: effects of opiates, Chloroacetaldehyde, and genetic variants on optic atrophy and muscle 
92671239|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between Drosophila and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with various cell lines, including MCF-7, HCT116, and PC-3, in the context of chemical exposure and genetic variation. The research focuses on the effects of opiates and Chloroacetaldehyde on cellular responses, particularly in relation to optic atrophy and muscle rigidity.   We conducted a comparative analysis of opiate and Chloroacetaldehyde exposure on Drosophila and HIV-infected cell lines, revealing distinct patterns of cellular response. The study also explores the association between the sequence variant G7958 and optic atrophy, finding a significant link that supports its role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between G7958 and muscle rigidity, suggesting a potential genetic basis for the co-occurrence of these phenotypic features.  In addition, the study demonstrates a positive correlation between optic atrophy and both G7958 and the sequence variant C311A, indicating that these genetic factors may contribute to the development of optic atrophy. The findings also highlight the importance of considering genetic variability, such as the C311A variant, in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying optic atrophy.   The results provide new insights into the interplay between chemical exposure, genetic variation, and phenotypic outcomes in both Drosophila and human cell lines, with implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for conditions such as optic atrophy and muscle rigidity.

89013477|t|Selenium, lipidemia, and Bernard-Soulier syndrome: genetic and cellular insights from C4-2B, C57BL/6, and hRPTEC cell lines in Mangifera indica Linn and bovin
89013477|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between selenium, lipidemia, and Bernard-Soulier syndrome across multiple biological systems. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we explore the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying these associations. Selenium was found to exhibit a positive correlation with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, as well as a positive correlation with lipidemia, suggesting a potential role in modulating both conditions. The association between selenium and Bernard-Soulier syndrome was further supported by its link to the 8 nucleotide deletion and the sequence variant p.G821S.   In addition, lipidemia was associated with the p.G821S variant and the 8 nucleotide deletion, indicating a shared genetic basis. The C4-2B cell line, known for its relevance in prostate cancer research, was used to model the effects of selenium on lipid metabolism and platelet function, both of which are impaired in Bernard-Soulier syndrome. The C57BL/6 and hRPTEC cell lines were employed to study the impact of selenium on lipid profiles and cellular responses in different tissue contexts.   The organism taxon Mangifera indica Linn was included to examine the role of selenium in plant-based models of lipid metabolism, while bovine models were used to validate findings in a mammalian system. Our results highlight the importance of selenium in the pathophysiology of Bernard-Soulier syndrome and lipidemia, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting these conditions. The repeated use of the C4-2B cell line underscores its utility in studying the molecular mechanisms of these diseases, while the multiple instances of the organism taxon 'bovine' reflect the broad applicability of our findings across species.

36318350|t|Genetic and molecular mechanisms linking liver disease, perforin, and sequence variants in the context of ATP
36318350|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic variants, molecular pathways, and disease progression in liver disease. This research investigates the association between liver disease and two specific sequence variants: c.G1714C and methionine to threonine substitution at codon 235. Both variants show a positive correlation with the development and severity of liver disease, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis.   The study also explores the functional relationship between perforin and the gene products LAMTOR-1 and -2. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate a significant association between perforin and LAMTOR-1 and -2, indicating a potential regulatory or cooperative role in cellular processes. These findings are further supported by the presence of ATP, which appears to modulate the activity of perforin and its interaction with LAMTOR-1 and -2.  In addition, the chemical entity TPA is shown to influence the expression levels of perforin and the stability of the sequence variant c.G1714C. The presence of picrotoxin, a known modulator of ion channels, is also linked to altered expression patterns of perforin and the sequence variants, suggesting a broader network of interactions.   Collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying liver disease and highlight the importance of genetic and chemical factors in disease progression. The findings may have implications for the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies.

30899549|a|Recent studies have revealed complex genetic and molecular interactions involving the sequence variant rs12910509, the gene SYT14, and the gene product FXIIIB in the regulation of skin pigmentation. These interactions have been explored in both human and animal models, including ginseng, bacteria, and rat systems. The sequence variant rs12910509 has been found to be associated with skin pigmentation, with a positive correlation observed between rs12910509 and skin pigmentation. Additionally, a positive correlation was noted between skin pigmentation and rs12910509, reinforcing the genetic link between these two entities.   The gene SYT14 has been shown to have a positive correlation with skin pigmentation, while a negative correlation was found between skin pigmentation and SYT14. This suggests a complex regulatory mechanism involving SYT14 in the context of skin pigmentation. Furthermore, FXIIIB has been found to have a positive correlation with skin pigmentation, but a negative correlation was also observed between FXIIIB and skin pigmentation, indicating a dual role for FXIIIB in this biological process.   Notably, FXIIIB and SYT14 have been found to be associated with each other, with both an association and a binding interaction reported between these two gene products. These findings suggest that FXIIIB and SYT14 may function in a coordinated manner to influence skin pigmentation. The interactions between these genetic elements have been studied in various organisms, including ginseng, bacteria, and rat models, highlighting the broad relevance of these findings across different biological systems.   The study also underscores the importance of considering the interplay between genetic variants and gene products in understanding the molecular basis of skin pigmentation. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying skin pigmentation and their potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.

87335895|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and regulatory relationships between AP7, PS, and Urotensin-II in the context of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors in C. elegans and the 253JB-V cell line. We demonstrate a positive correlation between PS and type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, as well as a positive correlation between Urotensin-II and these receptors. Additionally, we show that PS binds directly to both type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, while Urotensin-II also binds to these receptors, suggesting a potential functional synergy between these molecules.   Our findings further reveal a negative correlation between type I and type II TGF-beta receptors and PS, which may indicate a regulatory feedback mechanism. Notably, we observe a positive correlation between PS and Urotensin-II, suggesting that these two chemical entities may act in concert to modulate receptor activity.   In addition to these interactions, we identify an association between AP7 and the sequence variant C314A, which may provide insights into the functional consequences of this variant in the context of TGF-beta signaling. These results highlight the complex interplay between AP7, PS, Urotensin-II, and the TGF-beta receptor system in C. elegans and 253JB-V cells, with potential implications for understanding the molecular basis of receptor-mediated signaling in these organisms. The study also underscores the importance of C314A in modulating the activity of these pathways.

09325980|t|DRD4 c.304delA and cholinergic activity in horses: implications for acute renal failure and genetic var
09325980|a|A recent study in horses has revealed a significant association between the sequence variant c.304delA in the DRD4 gene and altered cholinergic activity, which may contribute to the development of acute renal failure. This research, conducted across a large cohort of horses, found that the presence of c.304delA was consistently linked to changes in cholinergic signaling, suggesting a potential mechanism by which this genetic variant influences renal function. Furthermore, the study demonstrated a negative correlation between DRD4 expression levels and cholinergic activity, indicating that higher DRD4 activity may suppress cholinergic pathways. These findings were corroborated through multiple experimental approaches, including gene expression analysis, behavioral assays, and physiological measurements. The results highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants, neurotransmitter systems, and disease outcomes in horses. Notably, the association between c.304delA and cholinergic activity was observed in all 14 instances of the sequence variant, while the negative correlation between DRD4 and cholinergic activity was consistently present across all 8 instances of DRD4. The study also found that acute renal failure was more prevalent in horses carrying the c.304delA variant, with 14 instances of the disease reported in this group. These findings provide new insights into the genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying acute renal failure in horses and underscore the importance of considering genetic variability in the management of this condition.

44578029|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of Multiple fibroadenomas, with a focus on the interplay between the ROCK and HSP82 proteins and the impact of the p.G159R sequence variant. Using a combination of biochemical assays and functional genomics, we demonstrate a positive correlation between ROCK and HSP82 expression in C57BL/6J, MEF, and Ishikawa cell lines. The p.G159R variant was found to be significantly associated with Multiple fibroadenomas, particularly in C57BL/6J and Ishikawa cell models. Our findings suggest that the p.G159R variant may disrupt the normal regulatory interactions between ROCK and HSP82, leading to the pathogenesis of Multiple fibroadenomas. Furthermore, we observed that the presence of the p.G159R variant correlates with increased ROCK activity and altered HSP82 expression levels in MEF and Ishikawa cell lines. These results highlight the potential of targeting the ROCK-HSP82 axis as a therapeutic strategy for Multiple fibroadenomas. The study also underscores the importance of cell line-specific responses to genetic variants, as the effects of p.G159R were most pronounced in C57BL/6J and Ishikawa cells. Overall, our data provide new insights into the molecular basis of Multiple fibroadenomas and the role of the p.G159R variant in modulating ROCK and HSP82 interactions.

75960817|t|Bovine cocaine addiction and metabolic alterations: genetic variants, norepinephrine dynamics, and interactions with rilmenidine and car
75960817|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, neurotransmitter dynamics, and metabolic changes in bovine models of cocaine addiction and associated phenotypes. We focus on the role of the sequence variant c.715_717delGTC in modulating norepinephrine levels, which show a positive correlation with this variant. Additionally, we explore the conversion between norepinephrine and terbutaline, as well as the conversion between norepinephrine and rilmenidine. Rilmenidine is found to be in a negative correlation with diarrhea, a common phenotypic feature in bovine cocaine addiction.    The sequence variant del418T is associated with triglyceride levels, and there is a conversion between triglyceride and rilmenidine. Furthermore, the 137-bp insertion is linked to both carotenoids and triglyceride, highlighting its potential role in metabolic regulation. Carotenoids are also negatively correlated with cocaine addiction, suggesting a protective effect against the disease.    In bovine models, the conversion between carotenoids and norepinephrine is observed, indicating a possible regulatory mechanism. The sequence variant 137-bp insertion is further associated with carotenoids, reinforcing its role in metabolic pathways. These findings provide new insights into the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying cocaine addiction and its associated metabolic disturbances in bovines.

24811491|a|Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic factors and disease phenotypes in the context of glomerulosclerosis, VSD, and skin reactions. This research explores the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, with a focus on the roles of antioxidant factors, thrombin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-4 in both Danio rerio and C. elegans models. The findings reveal a positive correlation between VSD and BMP-4, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for this condition. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between glomerulosclerosis and Purkinje cell atrophy associated protein-1, indicating a possible shared pathway in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The association between BMP-4 and Purkinje cell atrophy associated protein-1 further supports the involvement of these molecules in cellular stress responses. In parallel, the positive correlation between UP Ia and VCAM1 underscores the importance of these proteins in immune-mediated processes. The study also demonstrates the utility of MCF-7, SNU-C5, and Capan1 cell lines in modeling these interactions, with particular emphasis on the role of antioxidant factors in modulating disease progression. These results provide a foundation for future investigations into the molecular basis of glomerulosclerosis, VSD, and skin reactions, with implications for the development of targeted therapies.

93043690|t|Genetic variants in ACC and PKC: associations with lymphoma, palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma, and neuro
93043690|a|This study investigates the genetic and functional relationships between sequence variants in the ACC gene, the PKC gene, and the ARG2 gene, and their associations with lymphoma, palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma, and neurodeficits. We identified three instances of the sequence variant c.1970_2177del in patients with palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma, suggesting a strong association between this deletion and the disease. Additionally, we found that the valine (Val) to alanine (Ala) substitution at amino acid 16 is negatively correlated with the development of lymphoma, indicating a protective effect against this malignancy.   The gene product ACC was found to be associated with both PKC and ARG2, with a significant positive correlation between ACC and PKC, and a positive correlation between ACC and ARG2. However, palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma was negatively correlated with both PKC and ARG2, suggesting that these genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of this skin condition. Furthermore, we observed that the sequence variant Asp218Asn was present in multiple individuals with lymphoma, although its functional role remains to be determined.   Our findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants in ACC, PKC, and ARG2 and their associations with various diseases, including lymphoma and palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma. The negative correlation between palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma and PKC, as well as the negative correlation between palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma and ARG2, suggests that these genes may act as negative regulators in the development of this condition. The study also underscores the importance of further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.

75895879|a|This study investigates the intricate relationships between the chemotherapeutic agent S-1, the clinical condition Syncope, and the sequence variant c.610-2A>G in the context of CD18/HPAF cell lines and Rhodiola rosea. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between S-1 and Syncope, suggesting that S-1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of Syncope. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between p85alpha and Syncope, indicating that p85alpha may be a contributing factor to the occurrence of Syncope. However, a negative correlation was found between p85alpha and S-1, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship between these two entities.   The sequence variant c.610-2A>G was found to be associated with both p85alpha and the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, highlighting its potential role in modulating the expression or function of these gene products. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and Syncope, reinforcing the idea that this receptor may be involved in the mechanisms underlying Syncope.   Our results also demonstrate that CD18/HPAF cells, when exposed to Rhodiola rosea, exhibit altered expression patterns of p85alpha and the M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which may contribute to the observed correlations with Syncope. These findings provide a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms linking these entities and their potential therapeutic implications in the management of Syncope.

30345783|t|Paroxetine, Sodium Bicarbonate, and Renal Impairment: Interactions with Spirulina, Bovine, Glutathione-S-Transferase P1, DDR2, Tenascin-C, and Cytochrome P450 (
30345783|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between paroxetine, sodium bicarbonate, and renal impairment in the context of Spirulina and bovine models. Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to bind to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, which exhibits a positive correlation with both paroxetine and sodium bicarbonate. This binding interaction is further supported by the positive correlation between cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and sodium bicarbonate, suggesting a potential role for this enzyme in the metabolism of both compounds.   Sodium bicarbonate has been found to bind to tenascin-C, a gene product that is positively correlated with both sodium bicarbonate and renal impairment. This association is further reinforced by the positive correlation between tenascin-C and renal impairment, as well as the negative correlation between renal impairment and tenascin-C. Notably, the negative correlation between renal impairment and DDR2 suggests a potential protective role for DDR2 in the context of renal dysfunction.   Glutathione-S-transferase P1, a key enzyme in detoxification processes, has been found to have a positive correlation with paroxetine, indicating a possible interaction between these two entities. However, sodium bicarbonate exhibits a negative correlation with paroxetine, suggesting a competitive or inhibitory relationship.   The study also highlights the role of Spirulina and bovine models in understanding these interactions. These organisms have been used to investigate the effects of paroxetine, sodium bicarbonate, and their associated gene products, including tenascin-C and DDR2, on renal function and metabolic pathways. The findings suggest that the interplay between these chemical entities, gene products, and biological systems is complex and requires further investigation to fully understand their implications in health and disease.

93279609|a|This study explores the complex interactions between CD72, CD45RO, and Shh with Matrix metalloproteinases, p38, and various genetic variants in Daucus carota, Mangifera indica Linn, and horses. We investigated the binding interactions between CD45RO and CD72, as well as between Shh and CD45RO, revealing a significant bind between these molecules. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between CD45RO and CD72, while a negative correlation was observed between CD45RO and p38. The association between Shh and p38 was also confirmed, along with a positive correlation between Shh and CD72.   The study further examined the relationship between Matrix metalloproteinases and CD72, finding a negative correlation between these two entities. A negative correlation was also observed between Matrix metalloproteinases and Shh, and a positive correlation was noted between Matrix metalloproteinases and p38. The interaction between CD72 and Matrix metalloproteinases was confirmed through binding assays, and a negative correlation between CD72 and p38 was also identified.   Genetic variants were analyzed in detail, including the association between rs5393 and L351A, as well as between rs5393 and rs6235. The variant L180M was found to be associated with rs6235 and with the 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel), while N221D was linked to L180M, rs5393, and (CCTTT)13. The variant (CCTTT)13 was also associated with L351A and CD72. The variant c.342delA was found to be associated with p38, CD72, and N221D, and it was also linked to the 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel).   The 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel) was associated with CD45RO, p38, and L180M, while L351A was associated with N221D and CD72. The variant L180M was also found to be associated with CD72 and (CCTTT)13. The study also revealed a negative correlation between CD72 and CD45RO, and a negative correlation between p38 and CD45RO.   These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between these proteins and genetic variants in Daucus carota, Mangifera indica Linn, and horses, highlighting the potential for further research into their roles in biological processes and disease.

63002495|t|THRA and Lipid A interactions in murine models: implications for meningococcal disease and the role of 5-alpha-reductase type 2 and mela
63002495|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) and Lipid A in murine models, with a focus on their potential roles in meningococcal disease. Using HEK and HL-7702 cell lines, we demonstrate that THRA binds to Lipid A, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that may influence immune responses. Additionally, we show that 5-alpha-reductase type 2 binds to both Lipid A and melanotan II, indicating a possible cross-talk between lipid signaling and hormone pathways. The association between melanotan II and THRA further supports the hypothesis that these molecules may modulate inflammatory processes. Fluo-4AM, a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, was used to monitor intracellular calcium dynamics in response to melanotan II, revealing a direct association between the two. Furthermore, melanotan II was found to associate with Fluo-4AM, suggesting a functional link between the peptide and calcium signaling. These findings highlight the complex interplay between Lipid A, THRA, 5-alpha-reductase type 2, and melanotan II in murine systems, with potential implications for the pathogenesis of meningococcal disease. The use of murine models and multiple cell lines provides a robust framework for understanding these interactions at the molecular level.

88352003|t|Kilham rat virus, RB1, and ZnSO(4): interactions with glycine, MEN1, and Toxorynchites mosquitoes in tobacco
88352003|a|Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between Kilham rat virus, RB1, and ZnSO(4) in the context of glycine metabolism. The conversion between K + and glycine was observed in both in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting a potential regulatory role of K + in glycine homeostasis. Additionally, the binding of ZnSO(4) to RB1 was confirmed through biochemical assays, indicating a direct interaction that may influence cellular signaling pathways. The conversion between ZnSO(4) and glycine further supports the hypothesis that these chemical entities play a synergistic role in modulating gene expression.   Toxorynchites mosquitoes were found to be a significant vector in the transmission of Kilham rat virus, particularly in environments where tobacco is cultivated. Tobacco plants were shown to accumulate high levels of glycine and ZnSO(4), which may contribute to the persistence of the virus in these ecosystems. The presence of MEN1 in tobacco tissues was correlated with the expression levels of RB1, suggesting a potential regulatory network involving these gene products.   These findings highlight the intricate relationships between Kilham rat virus, RB1, ZnSO(4), glycine, Toxorynchites mosquitoes, and tobacco, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions.

12148722|t|Vitamin C, alcohol, and their interactions with AR, fibronectin, and glutathione peroxidase in the context of CDG-Ic a
12148722|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between Vitamin C, alcohol, and key molecular entities such as AR, fibronectin, and glutathione peroxidase in the context of CDG-Ic and DEN-4. The research focuses on the cotreatment of Vitamin C and alcohol, revealing significant biological implications. Using IEC-6 and MCF7/AdrR cell lines, we observed that Vitamin C and alcohol are cotreated in multiple experimental conditions, suggesting a potential synergistic or antagonistic effect.   Our findings indicate a negative correlation between Vitamin C and CDG-Ic, as well as between Vitamin C and fibronectin, which may suggest a regulatory role of Vitamin C in fibronectin expression. Similarly, a negative correlation was found between Vitamin C and AR, indicating that Vitamin C may modulate AR activity. Additionally, the negative correlation between AR and alcohol suggests that alcohol may influence AR expression or function.   The study also highlights a negative correlation between fibronectin and alcohol, which could imply that alcohol affects fibronectin levels in cellular models. Furthermore, glutathione peroxidase shows a negative correlation with both Vitamin C and alcohol, suggesting that these compounds may interfere with the antioxidant activity of glutathione peroxidase.   These results were consistently observed across multiple experiments involving DEN-4 and HBV organisms, emphasizing the broad relevance of these interactions. The findings provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Vitamin C and alcohol on cellular processes and disease states such as CDG-Ic.

29830209|a|This study investigates the molecular and genetic interactions between bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-4, caspase-8, and p70s6k in the context of juvenile polyposis and other phenotypic features. We report that the sequence variant rs1800872 is associated with altered expression of BMP-4 in human tissues, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of juvenile polyposis. Additionally, we find that the sequence variant del418T is linked to increased levels of BMP-4 in Spirulina-fed mice, suggesting a potential role for Spirulina in modulating BMP-4 activity.   Our findings also reveal a significant association between juvenile polyposis and p70s6k, with the gene product p70s6k showing a direct binding interaction with caspase-8. This binding is further supported by the observation that the sequence variant I146L in caspase-8 enhances its interaction with p70s6k. Moreover, we demonstrate that the gene product glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 modulates the binding of p70s6k to caspase-8, suggesting a complex regulatory network involving these proteins.  We also report that the gene product angiotensin II type-1 receptor binds to p70s6k, and this interaction is associated with infertility. Furthermore, we find that infertility is significantly associated with both the angiotensin II type-1 receptor and caspase-8, indicating a potential role for these proteins in reproductive health.   In addition, we observe that the sequence variant 'alanine for proline at amino acid 286' in the gene product p70s6k is linked to premature pubarche, while the sequence variant 'I146L' in caspase-8 is associated with nausea. The study also includes data from Toxorynchites mosquitoes and Daucus carota, which show differential expression of BMP-4 in response to environmental factors, suggesting a broader ecological and evolutionary context for these molecular interactions.  Overall, this research provides new insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying juvenile polyposis and other phenotypic features, highlighting the importance of BMP-4, caspase-8, and p70s6k in disease pathogenesis and physiological regulation.

31054284|t|Genetic Variants and Pharmacological Responses in Zebrafish Models: A Comprehensive Analysis of Sequence Variants, Cell Lines, and Chemical 
31054284|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, cell lines, and chemical entities in Zebrafish models to elucidate their roles in pharmacological responses and disease mechanisms. We focused on the sequence variants 'guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA)', 'del 92 nucleotide -19/+73', 'R3500Q', 'rs2004640', and 'arginine by glutamine at position 714', as well as the cell lines 'Huh7' and 'H446', and the chemical entities 'terbutaline' and '4-ene-VPA'.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between 'R3500Q' and '4-ene-VPA', suggesting that these variants may modulate the efficacy of 4-ene-VPA in Zebrafish models. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between 'rs2004640' and 'terbutaline', indicating that rs2004640 may influence the pharmacological response to terbutaline. The association between 'guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA)' and 'terbutaline' highlights a potential role for this sequence variant in modulating terbutaline's effects.   A comparison between '4-ene-VPA' and 'terbutaline' revealed distinct pharmacological profiles, with '4-ene-VPA' showing a positive correlation with 'guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA)'. Furthermore, '4-ene-VPA' was found to be negatively correlated with 'del 92 nucleotide -19/+73' and 'arginine by glutamine at position 714', while also being positively correlated with 'R3500Q' and 'rs2004640'. The negative correlation between 'del 92 nucleotide -19/+73' and 'terbutaline' suggests that this variant may act as a modulator of terbutaline's effects.   Notably, 'arginine by glutamine at position 714' was found to be associated with both '4-ene-VPA' and 'terbutaline', indicating a potential regulatory role in pharmacological responses. The positive correlation between 'terbutaline' and 'rs2004640' further supports the involvement of rs2004640 in modulating terbutaline's activity.   These results were validated using the Huh7 and H446 cell lines, which were used to model the effects of these genetic and chemical factors in Zebrafish. The study underscores the importance of understanding the interactions between genetic variants, cell lines, and chemical entities in the context of pharmacological responses and disease mechanisms.

58455444|t|Smad1 and Erk1 signaling in Ba/F3 cells: interactions with GCK and the role of mirtazapine in bra
58455444|a|This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Smad1 and Erk1 signaling pathways in Ba/F3 cells, with a focus on the regulatory role of GCK. We demonstrate that Smad1 and Erk1 exhibit distinct but overlapping functions in modulating cellular responses to various stimuli, including growth factors and cytokines. The expression of GCK is significantly upregulated in Ba/F3 cells under conditions of stress, suggesting a potential role for this gene in cellular adaptation.   Our findings reveal a negative correlation between mirtazapine and bradycardia, as evidenced by the observed reduction in heart rate in experimental models treated with mirtazapine. This effect is further supported by the association between mirtazapine and bradycardia, which is consistent with clinical reports linking the drug to cardiac side effects. Notably, the presence of GCK appears to modulate the extent of this effect, with higher GCK expression correlating with a diminished bradycardic response.  In addition to its effects on cardiac function, mirtazapine also influences the expression of Smad1 and Erk1 in Ba/F3 cells. These changes are particularly pronounced in the SMMC-7721 cell line, where mirtazapine treatment leads to a significant downregulation of Smad1 and a concomitant upregulation of Erk1. This suggests a complex interplay between these signaling pathways in response to pharmacological agents.   The study also highlights the importance of GCK in mediating the effects of mirtazapine on cardiac function, as GCK knockout models exhibit a more severe bradycardic response to the drug. These results provide new insights into the molecular basis of mirtazapine-induced bradycardia and underscore the need for further research into the therapeutic implications of these interactions.

96913820|t|Drosophila bcl-xl and clathrin interactions in cellular trafficking: implications for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and calbindin-D28k re
96913820|a|Recent studies have revealed a critical role for the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl in modulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process essential for cellular trafficking. This association between bcl-xl and clathrin was demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster models, where disruption of clathrin function led to impaired bcl-xl localization and increased apoptosis. These findings were corroborated in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected SMMC-7721 cells, where clathrin-dependent pathways were found to be dysregulated, potentially contributing to viral entry and replication.   In parallel, research on calbindin-D28k, a calcium-binding protein, has shown a positive correlation with clathrin expression in chick and mouse models. This correlation was further supported by in vitro experiments using Atorvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, which was found to enhance calbindin-D28k levels in a clathrin-dependent manner. Notably, this effect was observed in both chick and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cell lines, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for modulating calcium homeostasis in disease states.  Additionally, the interaction between dystrophin and clathrin was investigated in tobacco and mouse models, revealing a novel mechanism by which dystrophin stabilizes clathrin-coated pits during endocytosis. This interaction was further validated in SMMC-7721 cells, where dystrophin overexpression led to increased clathrin recruitment and enhanced endocytic activity. These findings highlight the complex interplay between clathrin and various proteins, including bcl-xl, calbindin-D28k, and dystrophin, across multiple species and disease contexts.

90606158|t|HNF-6 and bcl-xl interactions in ginseng and bovine cell lines: a comprehensive analysis of binding and regulatory relat
90606158|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6 and bcl-xl in the context of ginseng and bovine cell lines. Using a combination of molecular biology techniques, we demonstrate both negative and positive correlations between HNF-6 and bcl-xl, as well as direct binding interactions between the two proteins. The findings suggest that HNF-6 may act as a transcriptional regulator of bcl-xl, with implications for cell survival and apoptosis in both ginseng and bovine systems.   We examined the expression levels of HNF-6 and bcl-xl in the CMT-93, CD18/HPAF, and SF188 cell lines, which were derived from ginseng and bovine sources. In CMT-93 cells, a negative correlation was observed between HNF-6 and bcl-xl, while in CD18/HPAF cells, an association was noted. In SF188 cells, both a negative correlation and an association were detected, indicating cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms.   Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) confirmed that HNF-6 binds directly to bcl-xl in both ginseng and bovine cell lines. This binding was further validated through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, which showed that HNF-6 occupies the promoter region of the bcl-xl gene in these cell lines.   Our results highlight the dynamic relationship between HNF-6 and bcl-xl, with evidence of both negative and positive regulatory interactions. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cell survival and death in ginseng and bovine systems, with potential applications in biotechnology and regenerative medicine.

10254160|t|KU7 cell line and c.855 +1G>C sequence variant interactions in tobacco and viral infections: a study on Drosophila and Human Papillo
10254160|a|This study investigates the interactions between the KU7 cell line and the sequence variant c.855 +1G>C in the context of tobacco exposure and viral infections. The research focuses on the effects of this sequence variant on cellular responses in the KU7 cell line, which is frequently used in studies involving tobacco-related diseases. The c.855 +1G>C variant was found to significantly alter gene expression patterns in the KU7 cell line when exposed to tobacco extracts.   In addition, the study explores the role of the c.855 +1G>C variant in the susceptibility of the KU7 cell line to infections by Kilham rat virus and dengue virus type 2. The results indicate that the presence of this variant may enhance viral replication in the KU7 cell line, particularly under conditions of tobacco exposure.   The research also examines the impact of the c.855 +1G>C variant on the Drosophila model system, where it was observed to influence the expression of genes related to viral defense mechanisms. Furthermore, the study investigates the association between the variant and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection in the MH134 cell line, which is known to be susceptible to HPV.   The findings suggest that the c.855 +1G>C sequence variant may play a critical role in modulating the host response to both viral and environmental factors, such as tobacco. The study also highlights the importance of the KU7 cell line in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions. The results have implications for the development of targeted therapies for viral infections and tobacco-related diseases.

86985581|a|Recent studies have explored the multifaceted interactions between the antiretroviral drug efavirenz and various biological outcomes in both in vitro and in vivo models. This research focuses on the effects of efavirenz on DEN-4-infected PA-1 cells and its potential role in the development of infertility, radiculopathy, and obesity. The findings reveal a significant association between efavirenz and infertility, suggesting that efavirenz may contribute to reproductive dysfunction in DEN-4-infected PA-1 cells. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between efavirenz and radiculopathy, indicating that efavirenz may exacerbate or contribute to the development of radiculopathy in certain contexts.   Further analysis showed a strong positive correlation between efavirenz and obesity, with multiple instances of association between efavirenz and obese phenotypes. These results suggest that efavirenz may influence metabolic pathways that lead to weight gain and obesity. The study also examined the role of Aedes mosquitoes in the transmission of DEN-4 and its interaction with efavirenz. Notably, the presence of efavirenz in the environment was found to influence the expression of certain genes in Aedes mosquitoes, potentially affecting their ability to transmit DEN-4.   Moreover, the study explored the relationship between efavirenz and colon cancer, finding that efavirenz may have a protective effect against the development of colon cancer in certain cell lines. However, the association between efavirenz and radiculopathy was consistently observed across multiple models, reinforcing the need for further investigation into its potential neurotoxic effects. The findings highlight the complex interplay between efavirenz, DEN-4, and various disease states, including infertility, radiculopathy, and obesity, and underscore the importance of understanding these relationships in both clinical and ecological contexts.

77738027|t|CFHR1, LYAR, and SDHx: Interactions with iNOS, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and opioid peptides in congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome and langua
77738027|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions and functional relationships between CFHR1, LYAR, SDHx, iNOS, low-density lipoprotein receptor, opioid peptides, and their associations with congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome and language delay. Using a combination of biochemical assays and bioinformatics approaches, we demonstrate that CFHR1 binds to both iNOS and low-density lipoprotein receptor, while LYAR interacts with CFHR1. SDHx is found to bind to both low-density lipoprotein receptor and iNOS, suggesting a potential role in modulating these interactions. Opioid peptides are shown to bind to iNOS, and this interaction is further linked to the association between opioid peptides and language delay. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between opioid peptides and language delay, indicating a possible inhibitory effect. The study also reveals a negative correlation between STZ and low-density lipoprotein receptor, as well as between STZ and congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome. Fluoxetine is associated with congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome, but it exhibits a negative correlation with the same condition, suggesting complex regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, bcl-xl is found to bind to LYAR, highlighting potential roles in cellular signaling pathways. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome and language delay, and they underscore the importance of these interactions in disease pathogenesis. The results also suggest that the interactions between CFHR1, LYAR, SDHx, iNOS, and low-density lipoprotein receptor may be critical in modulating the effects of opioid peptides and other chemical entities on cellular function.

71975042|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase and various chemical entities, including curcumin and antipyretic, in the context of disease progression and therapeutic response. A positive correlation was observed between N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase and curcumin, suggesting a potential synergistic effect in modulating cellular pathways involved in inflammation and tumor suppression. Similarly, a positive correlation was found between N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase and antipyretic, indicating a possible role in mitigating fever-related symptoms and inflammatory responses. However, a negative correlation was noted between antipyretic and toxicities, highlighting the need for careful dosing to avoid adverse effects. Additionally, a negative correlation was identified between Sch and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, suggesting that Sch may have a protective role in autoimmune conditions.   The study also examined the impact of Allopurinol on angioedema and gynecologic malignancy, revealing a negative correlation between Allopurinol and both conditions, which may have implications for its use in patients with these disorders. Furthermore, the role of antipyretic in relation to angioedema was found to be negative, reinforcing the importance of monitoring for allergic reactions in patients receiving antipyretic therapy.   In the context of viral infections, the study included analyses of West Nile virus, Kilham rat virus, and tobacco, with particular attention to the interactions between these organisms and the chemical entities under investigation. The presence of ginseng and Spirulina was also noted, as these organisms may influence the metabolic pathways affected by the studied compounds.   Overall, the findings underscore the intricate relationships between N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase, various chemical entities, and disease states, providing a foundation for future research into targeted therapeutic strategies for gynecologic malignancy and other conditions associated with toxicities.

90918610|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between paracetamol, Derp1, Serpina 3g, and low-density lipoprotein in the context of MH134 cell biology. Paracetamol, a widely used analgesic and antipyretic, was found to modulate the expression of Derp1 and Serpina 3g in MH134 cells. The negative correlation between Derp1 and Serpina 3g was consistently observed across multiple experimental conditions, suggesting a regulatory relationship where increased Derp1 expression is associated with decreased Serpina 3g levels.   Further analysis revealed that low-density lipoprotein exhibits a significant association with Serpina 3g, indicating a potential role for lipoprotein metabolism in the regulation of this gene. The association between Derp1 and Serpina 3g was also confirmed through co-expression studies, reinforcing the bidirectional relationship between these two gene products. Additionally, the association between Serpina 3g and Derp1 was further supported by functional assays, where changes in Serpina 3g expression influenced the activity of Derp1 in MH134 cells.  These findings highlight the intricate interplay between paracetamol, Derp1, Serpina 3g, and low-density lipoprotein in cellular processes. The study underscores the importance of understanding these molecular interactions for developing targeted therapeutic strategies in metabolic and inflammatory diseases.

51424595|a|This study investigates the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the associations between specific sequence variants, including dup27bp and CAG repeat, and disease phenotypes such as adenoid cystic carcinoma and ventriculomegaly. Using a combination of genomic, transcriptomic, and cellular approaches, we examined these associations in multiple model systems, including rhesus monkeys, chick, and Toxorynchites mosquitoes. The DUCaP cell line was used as a primary model for studying the effects of dup27bp and CAG repeat on cellular behavior, while the SNU-C5, LbetaT2, and Ba/F3 cell lines were employed to assess the functional consequences of these sequence variants in different cellular contexts. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between dup27bp and adenoid cystic carcinoma, as well as between dup27bp and ventriculomegaly. Additionally, we observed a strong association between adenoid cystic carcinoma and CAG repeat, with a positive correlation between CAG repeat and adenoid cystic carcinoma. The association between ventriculomegaly and CAG repeat, as well as between ventriculomegaly and dup27bp, was further supported by our data. These results suggest that dup27bp and CAG repeat may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The study also highlights the importance of using diverse model organisms, including rhesus monkeys, chick, and Toxorynchites mosquitoes, to better understand the genetic and cellular basis of these conditions. The DUCaP, SNU-C5, LbetaT2, and Ba/F3 cell lines were consistently used across multiple experiments to ensure reproducibility and robustness of the findings.

22748915|t|Genetic variants, gene expression, and disease associations in Aedes mosquitoes and human ce
22748915|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, gene expression, and disease phenotypes in both Aedes mosquitoes and human cell lines. A key focus is on the sequence variant rs1800734, which is associated with multiple genes and disease features. rs1800734 shows a significant association with the gene SPO11, as well as with collagen, suggesting a potential role in structural and functional pathways. Additionally, rs1800734 is linked to the gene PrlR, which is further associated with hyperthyroidism. These findings highlight the importance of rs1800734 in modulating gene expression and disease susceptibility.   Collagen is also directly associated with hyperthyroidism, indicating a possible role in the pathophysiology of this condition. The gene NDE1 is found to be associated with hyperthyroidism, reinforcing the genetic complexity of this disease. Furthermore, the gene SPO11 is linked to hyperthyroidism, suggesting a broader network of genetic interactions.   The study also examines the expression of these genes in various cell lines, including Hs578T and Ishikawa. The Ishikawa cell line, in particular, is used to model the effects of these genetic variants on cellular processes. The Hs578T cell line is employed to study the interactions between collagen and other genes in the context of disease.   The research further explores the role of bacteria in modulating these genetic associations, with four instances of the organism taxon 'bacteria' indicating their potential influence on gene expression and disease outcomes. The findings suggest that the interplay between genetic variants, gene products, and environmental factors such as bacteria may contribute to the development and progression of hyperthyroidism.   Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying hyperthyroidism, with implications for both basic research and clinical applications.

42174782|t|Letrozole and losartan interactions with RAD51, GALT, and other molecular targets in metabolic and neurological 
42174782|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between letrozole and losartan, two pharmacological agents with diverse therapeutic applications, and their associations with key molecular targets such as RAD51, GALT, and the serotonin transporter. The research highlights the conversion between letrozole and losartan, suggesting potential pharmacodynamic cross-talk in metabolic pathways. Additionally, the study identifies an association between RAD51 and VAL, indicating a possible role for VAL in DNA repair mechanisms. The conversion between VAL and Cyclooxygenase inhibitors is further explored, suggesting a regulatory link between these compounds in inflammatory responses.   GALT is found to be associated with VAL, potentially implicating this gene in metabolic processes involving amino acid metabolism. The conversion between norepinephrine and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase is demonstrated, highlighting a potential role for norepinephrine in calcium homeostasis. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase is also shown to convert to malonic acid, suggesting a metabolic pathway involving mitochondrial function. Malonic acid, in turn, is converted to GSH, indicating a role in redox regulation and cellular protection.  The association between the low-density lipoprotein receptor and Mg+2 ATPase is examined, providing insights into lipid metabolism and cellular energy dynamics. The muscarinic cholinergic system is found to be associated with malonic acid, suggesting a potential link between cholinergic signaling and metabolic regulation.   The study also includes a comprehensive analysis of sequence variants, including 111G, 2172_2173insCCCC, rs11798018, V876E, rs17250932, dup24bp, C111G (twice), IVS3+1G>A (twice), and R246W (twice), which are associated with various gene products such as GALT, serotonin transporter, nephrin, transferrin receptor 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and RAD51. These variants are linked to functional changes, including the substitution of asparagine 86 for alanine and the elimination of amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline).   Finally, the conversion between Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and opioid peptides is demonstrated, suggesting a potential role for these compounds in pain modulation and inflammatory responses. The findings provide a framework for understanding the complex interplay between chemical entities, gene products, and sequence variants in metabolic and neurological pathways.

48721118|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of rilmenidine, alendronate, and aminoglycosides in iron deficiency and hypoxia-related pat
48721118|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between genetic variants, pharmacological agents, and disease states in the context of iron deficiency and hypoxia. This research focuses on the associations between the sequence variant P163S and the drug rilmenidine, which was found to exhibit a positive correlation with iron deficiency. Additionally, the chemical entity alendronate showed a positive correlation with both iron deficiency and STS, as well as a positive correlation with hypoxia. The aminoglycoside class of drugs was also found to have a positive correlation with iron deficiency and hypoxia, suggesting a potential synergistic effect in these conditions. The sequence variant 338G>A was associated with rilmenidine, further highlighting the genetic underpinnings of drug response. The cell line HK2 was used to model the effects of these compounds on iron homeostasis, while MC3T3-E1, PA-1, and hRPTEC were employed to study their impact on cellular responses under hypoxic conditions. Bisphosphonates, including alendronate, were found to have a positive correlation with hypoxia, reinforcing their role in modulating cellular metabolism in low-oxygen environments. The sequence variant C262 was also linked to the pharmacological response to bisphosphonates, indicating a potential genetic basis for variability in drug efficacy. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between genetic factors, pharmacological agents, and disease states in the context of iron deficiency and hypoxia-related disorders.

16115465|t|X-ray repair cross-complementing gene variants and their associations with sequence alterations in dogs and mouse mammary tum
16115465|a|The X-ray repair cross-complementing (XRCC) gene plays a critical role in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in the context of double-strand break repair. This study investigates the functional and phenotypic consequences of specific sequence variants in the XRCC gene across multiple species, including dogs and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We identified three instances of the sequence variant c.1546_1547insC, which was found to be associated with both the frameshift variant P686fs and the missense variant A190T. These associations were confirmed through in silico modeling and experimental validation using cell lines derived from dogs. Additionally, the sequence variant 5.5 kb deletion was found to co-occur with A190T, suggesting a potential functional link between these two variants. The A190T variant was also observed in conjunction with c.1546_1547insC, reinforcing the hypothesis that these sequence alterations may act synergistically in modulating the expression and function of the XRCC gene. In horses, we observed two instances of the A190T variant, which was not associated with the 5.5 kb deletion. The study also included five instances of the sequence variant p.T286M, which was found to be present in both dogs and MMTV, but not in horses. These findings highlight the complex interplay between different sequence variants in the XRCC gene and their potential impact on DNA repair efficiency across species. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.

64272231|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interplay between dopaminergic drugs, Hypoxia, and genetic factors in Toxorynchites mosquitoes. Researchers have demonstrated that exposure to dopaminergic drugs significantly modulates Hypoxia-related pathways, with a notable negative correlation observed between bupivacaine and Hypoxia levels in experimental models. This finding suggests that bupivacaine may act as a protective agent against Hypoxia-induced cellular stress in these organisms.   The role of NF-kappaB in mediating these effects has been extensively investigated, with multiple studies showing that NF-kappaB activation is both necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional response to Hypoxia. This pathway appears to be conserved across various species, including Drosophila, which has been used as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms underlying Hypoxia tolerance.   In parallel, the impact of hereditary diseases on cellular responses to Hypoxia has been examined using a range of cell lines, including DUCaP, BALB/c, and Capan1. These cell lines have been shown to exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression and signaling activation under Hypoxia conditions, highlighting the importance of genetic background in determining cellular resilience.   Interestingly, the presence of dibucaine and d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate has been found to modulate the activity of NF-kappaB in a dose-dependent manner, further complicating the relationship between Hypoxia and genetic factors. Additionally, the study of Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome in Drosophila has provided insights into the broader implications of Hypoxia-related pathways in neurodevelopmental disorders.   These findings underscore the intricate relationship between chemical entities, genetic factors, and environmental stressors in shaping cellular responses to Hypoxia, with significant implications for both basic research and clinical applications.

25616001|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions in cancer cell lines: effects of sequence variants, corticosterone, and CYP3A4 inhibitors on drug response and protein ex
25616001|a|This study investigates the interplay between genetic variants, corticosterone, and pharmacological agents in modulating drug response and protein expression in three distinct cancer cell lines: DUCaP, HL-7702, and SF188. We focused on the sequence variants A207D, A49T, c.1475G>A, c.611delG, and the glutamine repeat, as well as the chemical entities corticosterone, lamivudine, pravastatin, sulfonylurea, and CYP3A4 inhibitors. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between the A207D variant and lamivudine treatment, suggesting that this variant may reduce the efficacy of lamivudine in these cell lines. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between corticosterone and the glutamine repeat, indicating that corticosterone may enhance the expression or stability of the glutamine repeat-containing protein. Notably, the association between c.1475G>A and A207D suggests a potential genetic interaction that may influence drug metabolism or response. A positive correlation between lamivudine and c.611delG was also identified, implying that the presence of this deletion may enhance the antiviral activity of lamivudine. The negative correlation between the glutamine repeat and corticosterone was further supported by the positive correlation between sulfonylurea and the glutamine repeat, suggesting a complex regulatory network involving these genetic and pharmacological factors. Additionally, the positive correlation between CYP3A4 inhibitors and A207D highlights the potential for these inhibitors to modulate the expression or function of the A207D variant. Finally, a positive correlation between pravastatin and c.611delG was observed, indicating that pravastatin may influence the stability or activity of this deletion variant. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying drug response and genetic variability in cancer cell lines.

36780782|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between organophosphorus compounds and various cellular pathways across multiple species and cell lines. We focus on the associations between organophosphorus and key molecular entities such as Let-7b, CD45, and Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2, as well as the binding interactions between these compounds and specific proteins. The findings reveal a significant association between organophosphorus and Let-7b, suggesting a potential regulatory role in gene expression. Additionally, organophosphorus is found to be associated with CD45, and a positive correlation is observed between CD45 and TIPE2, indicating a possible functional link between these molecules.   The study also demonstrates that 4-DAMP binds to p21 and is associated with CD45, highlighting its role in modulating cellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, trypan blue is shown to bind to Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 and is associated with TIPE2, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes related to these proteins. A positive correlation is observed between Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 and p21, reinforcing the interconnectedness of these pathways.   Vigabatrin is found to bind to both CD45 and Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2, indicating its potential as a modulator of these pathways. Moreover, a positive correlation is established between Let-7b and p21, further supporting the idea of coordinated regulation of these molecular entities. These findings are explored in the context of various cell lines, including C57BL/6, KU7, MH134 (six instances), MC3T3-E1, H9c2, and the organism taxons rhesus monkeys, mouse mammary tumor virus, cats, and dogs. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of how organophosphorus compounds interact with cellular components across different biological systems.

28444728|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, cell lines, and gene products in the context of cancer progression and drug response. The focus is on the sequence variant 1284A>C, which was found to be associated with altered expression of the gene product PI3K in the MCF-7 cell line. Additionally, the sequence variant C1007G was linked to the nine-nucleotide deletion starting at position 1952, which was observed in multiple instances across different cell lines. The sequence variant (G --> C) substitution at position 1201 was found to modulate the activity of the gene product nAchR in the SCID-HuH-7 cell line.    The chemical entity mangiferin was shown to have a significant association with the gene products nAchR and STAT3, as well as with the gene product OSX. Mangiferin also exhibited a synergistic effect with the chemical entity 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine, which was found to interact with the gene products SOX10, OSX, PI3K, and STAT3. Methadone was found to have a strong association with the gene products STAT3, PI3K, and SOX10, and its effects were further modulated by the sequence variant 1284A>C.    The gene product nAchR was found to be significantly associated with both mangiferin and Methadone, suggesting a potential dual role in modulating drug response. The gene product OSX was found to interact with both mangiferin and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine, while the gene product SOX10 was associated with all three chemical entities: mangiferin, Methadone, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine. The gene product PI3K was found to interact with both mangiferin and Methadone, as well as with the chemical entity 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine.    These findings highlight the intricate relationships between genetic variants, cell lines, and gene products in the context of drug response and cancer progression. The results suggest that the combination of genetic and pharmacological factors may play a critical role in determining therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.

70283367|t|Genetic and pharmacological interactions of ester, etomidate, and sequence variants in Mouse and shee
70283367|a|Recent studies have explored the complex interactions between ester compounds, anesthetic agents like etomidate, and genetic variants in both Mouse and sheep models. A significant positive correlation was observed between ester and etomidate, suggesting that ester compounds may modulate the pharmacological effects of etomidate. Similarly, ester was found to be positively correlated with the sequence variant c.474delA, indicating a potential functional relationship between these entities. Etomidate also showed a positive correlation with c.474delA, further supporting the hypothesis that this sequence variant may influence the response to anesthetic agents.   In addition, etomidate was found to be positively correlated with the sequence variant rs2073601, which is known to be associated with the gene Sp4. This correlation suggests that rs2073601 may play a role in the regulation of Sp4 expression, which in turn could affect the metabolic response to etomidate. The sequence variant 217_218insC was also found to be positively correlated with etomidate, indicating that this insertion may influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug.   The gene GLUT2 was found to be significantly associated with the sequence variant c.474delA in Mouse models, suggesting that this variant may affect the transport of glucose and other molecules. The gene TLR1 was also implicated in the response to ester compounds, highlighting the role of immune-related pathways in the metabolism of these chemicals.   In sheep, the gene SCF was found to be associated with the sequence variant rs2073601, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways. The gene OSX was also linked to the sequence variant 217_218insC, indicating that this variant may influence bone development and regeneration.   These findings underscore the importance of genetic and pharmacological interactions in the response to ester and etomidate, and highlight the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations in both Mouse and sheep models.

17977201|a|This study investigates the molecular interactions between bovine IL-7 and the insulin-receptor in C57BL/6 and MES-SA/Dx5 cell lines, with a focus on the effects of genetic variants on MMP-9 expression. We observed a positive correlation between insulin-receptor and MMP-9, as well as a negative correlation between insulin-receptor and MMP-9, suggesting complex regulatory mechanisms. The association between IL-7 and insulin-receptor was confirmed through binding assays, and further evidence of a bind between IL-7 and MMP-9 was provided. Additionally, a bind between insulin-receptor and MMP-9 was identified, supporting the positive correlation between MMP-9 and IL-7.   Genetic variants were analyzed in bovine samples, including p.Val167Met, M235T, and p.K543X. The association between M235T and p.K543X was found, as well as between p.K543X and IL-7, and between M235T and IL-7. The variant p.Val167Met was associated with MMP-9, reinforcing the link between genetic variation and gene expression. The study also included bovine cell lines CA3 and C57BL/6, with multiple instances of the cell lines MES-SA/Dx5 and C57BL/6 used to validate findings across different experimental conditions. These results highlight the intricate relationships between IL-7, insulin-receptor, and MMP-9 in bovine systems, with implications for understanding gene regulation and variant function.

19889319|a|This study investigates the functional and molecular consequences of the D90A sequence variant in the context of p38 and Alb expression across multiple organisms, including S. cerevisiae, rabbit, Platonia insignis Mart, tobacco, rhesus monkeys, and sheep. The D90A variant was found to significantly alter the phosphorylation dynamics of p38, leading to changes in downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, the variant was associated with altered expression levels of Alb, suggesting a potential regulatory role in gene expression.   The study also explored the interactions between the chemical entities disulfiram and lidocaine, both of which were found to modulate the activity of p38 and influence Alb expression. Notably, disulfiram and lidocaine exhibited a synergistic effect in altering the phosphorylation state of p38, which was further supported by in vitro assays. These findings suggest a potential drug interaction between disulfiram and lidocaine, which may have implications for therapeutic applications.   Furthermore, the association between lidocaine and Alb was confirmed through transcriptomic analysis, where lidocaine treatment led to a significant upregulation of Alb in multiple species. This interaction was consistent across different experimental conditions, reinforcing the biological relevance of the observed relationship. The results highlight the importance of considering sequence variants like D90A in the context of drug interactions and gene expression regulation.

31276004|a|This study investigates the complex interplay between genetic variants, metabolic markers, and disease phenotypes in a model system of HBV-infected Rats. We focus on the sequence variant g.3395C>T and its association with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, as well as the impact of the variant rs368698783 on fluvastatin metabolism. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between ALT and multiple enchondromatosis syndromes, suggesting a potential metabolic pathway linking these conditions. Additionally, we observe a drug interaction between ALT and fluvastatin, with evidence of conversion between the two entities. The variant g.3395C>T is associated with both ALT and fluvastatin, highlighting its role in modulating metabolic responses. The variant rs368698783 is also linked to fluvastatin and ALT, further supporting a genetic basis for these interactions. Notably, fluvastatin shows a positive correlation with both ALT and multiple enchondromatosis syndromes, indicating a potential therapeutic target. These results underscore the importance of genetic and metabolic factors in the pathogenesis of these conditions and provide a foundation for future research into their molecular mechanisms in HBV-infected Rats.

01874204|a|This study investigates the complex interactions between ciprofloxacin, melanotan II, and various disease states, including Pituitary adenomas, Retinoblastoma, and masseter muscle rigidity, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models. The research focuses on the MCF-7, SNU-C2A, C57BL/6, C4-2B, and HEK293 cell lines, which were exposed to varying concentrations of ciprofloxacin and melanotan II to assess their biological effects.   A significant positive correlation was observed between ciprofloxacin and congenital panocular disorder, suggesting a potential role for this antibiotic in the pathogenesis of this rare condition. Additionally, ciprofloxacin showed a positive correlation with Retinoblastoma, indicating possible therapeutic or toxicological implications in ocular malignancies. The study also found a positive correlation between melanotan II and Pituitary adenomas, supporting the hypothesis that this peptide may influence the growth or progression of these tumors.  Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between alanine aminotransferase and Pituitary adenomas, as well as between masseter muscle rigidity and alanine aminotransferase, highlighting the potential involvement of this enzyme in both metabolic and neuromuscular disorders. A comparison between ciprofloxacin and alanine aminotransferase demonstrated that ciprofloxacin may modulate the activity of this enzyme, which could have implications for drug metabolism and toxicity.  Notably, drowsiness was found to be positively correlated with melanotan II, suggesting a possible side effect or pharmacological mechanism of action. The study also included a comparison between ciprofloxacin and alanine aminotransferase, which provided insights into the metabolic interactions of these compounds. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay between chemical entities and disease states in both cellular and clinical contexts.
