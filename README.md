## Step 1: Download Qwen3-8B
Create a folder Qwen3-8B/ in the working directory on Cheaha.
Run the following command to perform the download:
```
sbatch downloader.sh
```
The download may take a few minutes. You can check on progress
using the "sacct" command from command line, since this creates
and submits a new job to the supercomputer.
